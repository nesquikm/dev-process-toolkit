# Gate Check

Run the project's gating checks and report a clear pass/fail for each.

## Commands

Read the project's CLAUDE.md to find the gate check commands (look for "Key Commands" or "Gating rule" section). If no CLAUDE.md exists, ask the user what commands to run.

Typical commands by stack (use as fallback if CLAUDE.md doesn't specify):
<!-- ADAPT: If copying this skill manually, replace with your project's commands -->
1. Run typecheck: `npm run typecheck` (or `fvm flutter analyze`, `mypy .`, etc.)
2. Run lint: `npm run lint $ARGUMENTS` (if `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--fix`, add `-- --fix`)
3. Run tests: `npm run test` (or `fvm flutter test`, `pytest`, etc.)
4. Run build: `npm run build` (optional — include if your project has a build step)

## Reporting

For each step:

- If it passes, report ✓ with the actual output summary (e.g., "✓ Tests: 47 passed, 0 failed")
- If it fails, report ✗ with the specific errors (include file:line references)

**Cite actual output numbers** — do not report GATE PASSED from memory of a previous run. Run each command fresh and read the result.

If a failure cause is unclear after reading the error output, use `/dev-process-toolkit:debug` for structured investigation.

## Code Review

After all commands pass, review the **changed code**. Use `git diff` against the base branch (e.g., `git diff main...HEAD`) if on a feature branch, or `git diff HEAD~1` if on the main branch. If there are uncommitted changes, include `git diff` (unstaged) and `git diff --cached` (staged) as well. Your job here is to find problems, not to praise the work. Approach this as if reviewing someone else's code — look for what's wrong, not what's right.

Grade against this rubric:

| Criterion | Critical? | What to check |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Spec compliance** | Yes | Every AC has a corresponding test. No undocumented behavior added. |
| **Security** | Yes | Input validated at boundaries. No injection risks. No secrets in code. |
| **Edge cases** | No | Empty/null inputs handled. Boundary values tested. Error paths exercised. |
| **Consistency** | No | Follows project patterns from CLAUDE.md. No style drift. |

<!-- ADAPT: Add domain-specific criteria for your stack -->
<!-- Examples: -->
<!-- Flutter: Widget tests for UI, no missing l10n keys, proper disposal -->
<!-- API: Auth on all endpoints, rate limiting, error response format -->
<!-- Web: Accessibility, XSS prevention, CSP headers -->

For each criterion, report: **OK** or **CONCERN** with specifics.

## Verdict

Combine command results + code review into a final verdict:

- **GATE PASSED** — all commands pass AND no concerns in code review
- **GATE PASSED WITH NOTES** — all commands pass but code review found non-critical concerns (list them). These are things the user should be aware of but that don't block merging.
- **GATE FAILED** — any command failed OR code review found critical concerns (spec compliance or security issues)

Always state what needs fixing if not a clean pass.

## Rules

- The **commands** (typecheck, lint, tests, build) are the **deterministic kill switch** — if any command fails, it's GATE FAILED. Period. No judgment can override a failing command.
- The **code review** is an additional advisory layer — it can elevate GATE PASSED to GATE PASSED WITH NOTES (non-critical) or GATE FAILED (critical: security or spec violations). But it cannot downgrade a failing command to a pass.
- Do NOT skip any step — run all commands AND the code review
- Do NOT report GATE PASSED without running commands fresh this session

## Red Flags

If you hear yourself thinking any of these, stop and run the gate anyway:

- "I'll run gate-check after the next task" → run it now
- "I know the tests pass" → run them and read the actual output
- "It should work now" → "should" is not a gate result
- "Just this once I'll skip it" → there is no just this once
