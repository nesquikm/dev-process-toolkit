# Gate Check

Run the project's gating checks and report a clear pass/fail for each.

## Commands

Read the project's CLAUDE.md to find the gate check commands (look for "Key Commands" or "Gating rule" section). If no CLAUDE.md exists, ask the user what commands to run.

Typical commands by stack (use as fallback if CLAUDE.md doesn't specify):
<!-- ADAPT: If copying this skill manually, replace with your project's commands -->
1. Run typecheck: `npm run typecheck` (or `fvm flutter analyze`, `mypy .`, etc.)
2. Run lint: `npm run lint $ARGUMENTS` (if `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--fix`, add `-- --fix`)
3. Run tests: `npm run test` (or `fvm flutter test`, `pytest`, etc.)
4. Run build: `npm run build` (optional — include if your project has a build step)

## Reporting

For each step:

- If it passes, report ✓ with the actual output summary (e.g., "✓ Tests: 47 passed, 0 failed")
- If it fails, report ✗ with the specific errors (include file:line references)

At the end, give a clear verdict: **GATE PASSED** or **GATE FAILED** with what needs fixing.

**Cite actual output numbers** — do not report GATE PASSED from memory of a previous run. Run each command fresh and read the result.

If a failure cause is unclear after reading the error output, use `/dev-process-toolkit:debug` for structured investigation.

## Rules

- This is a **deterministic kill switch** — if it fails, the gate fails. Period.
- Do NOT let judgment override a failing gate
- Do NOT skip any step
- Do NOT report GATE PASSED without running commands fresh this session

## Red Flags

If you hear yourself thinking any of these, stop and run the gate anyway:

- "I'll run gate-check after the next task" → run it now
- "I know the tests pass" → run them and read the actual output
- "It should work now" → "should" is not a gate result
- "Just this once I'll skip it" → there is no just this once
