## [1.22.0] — 2026-04-23 — "Branch Convention"

M19 adds opt-in branch-naming automation to `/implement`, hardens `TrackerProvider.releaseLock` against the `Backlog → Done` silent-leap trap, codifies the `<tracker-id>` placeholder convention in draft flows, retires 26-char ULIDs from tracker-mode user-facing prose, and sweeps 31 legacy files from the M12–M18 accumulation. Five FRs (STE-63..STE-67).

### Added

- **STE-64 — Branch automation in `/implement`.** New Schema L key `branch_template:` (additive, backward-compatible). Default values seeded by `/setup` step 7c: `{type}/m{N}-{slug}` in `mode: none`, `{type}/{ticket-id}-{slug}` in tracker modes. `/implement` Phase 1 adds sub-step 0.b″ between resolver entry and `claimLock`: if the current branch is `main`/`master` or fails to encode the milestone/FR identifier, run a single LLM pass for `{type, slug}`, render via new `adapters/_shared/src/branch_proposal.ts`, and prompt `[Y] accept / [e] edit / [n] abort`. `Y` → `git checkout -b`; `n` → clean exit with zero side effects; `git checkout -b` failure → NFR-10 canonical refusal. Absent `branch_template:` ⇒ branch automation disabled (existing projects tolerated silently). Sanitizer clamps LLM-returned `{type}`/`{slug}` to `[a-z0-9-]` before template substitution — defense in depth against shell-metachar injection (`$()`, backticks, newlines, path traversal, Unicode homoglyphs, all covered by adversarial-input unit tests). Rendered name exceeding 60 chars truncates the slug only; empty post-truncation slug throws `EmptySlugError` rather than ship a malformed `feat/m19-` branch. Two new test files (`branch_proposal.test.ts` 16 test blocks, `branch_acceptable.test.ts` 12 tests). New `/gate-check` probe #10 asserts `branch_template:` appears in `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`, backed by `tests/gate-check-branch-template-hygiene.test.ts`. Only `/implement` reads the key — `/tdd`, `/debug`, `/spec-write`, `/gate-check`, `/pr`, `/spec-archive`, `/spec-review`, `/visual-check`, `/simplify`, `/brainstorm` are explicitly out of scope. **User-facing impact:** downstream projects that re-run `/setup` (or hand-add `branch_template:` to their Schema L block) pick up branch automation; projects that don't touch their CLAUDE.md stay on the pre-M19 behavior. Full flow: `docs/implement-reference.md` § Branch Proposal (STE-64).
- **STE-65 — `TrackerProvider.releaseLock` pre-state assertion.** New `TrackerReleaseLockPreconditionError` (NFR-10 canonical shape) raised when the pre-release `getTicketStatus` probe returns anything other than `"in_progress"`. Guards against the `Backlog → Done` silent-leap path surfaced during the M18 dogfood (STE-60..STE-62 tickets got no `startedAt` timestamp because `claimLock` was skipped yet `releaseLock` happily transitioned to Done anyway). No extra MCP call — the check reuses the existing `getTicketStatus` fetch that the post-write `updatedAt` guard already performs (NFR-8 call budget preserved). `LocalProvider.releaseLock` is unchanged — `mode: none` has no tracker state to assert. Five new negative-path tests (each rejected pre-state: `backlog`, `unstarted`, `cancelled`, `done`, `completed`) assert the throw type, the canonical-shape error substrings, and that `transitionStatus` was not called. `adapters/linear.md` gains a "claimLock-skipped trap" subsection alongside the existing "Silent no-op trap". **User-facing impact:** `/implement` runs that accidentally skip Phase 1 `claimLock` (or operate on a ticket moved out-of-band) now fail loudly at Phase 4 Close with a `TrackerReleaseLockPreconditionError` naming the ticket + observed status + remedy, instead of silently transitioning Backlog → Done. Operators who manually moved a ticket to Done between claim and release must rerun the skill (or manually revert the status).
- **STE-66 — `<tracker-id>` placeholder convention in draft flows.** New prose rule in `/spec-write` step 0b and `/brainstorm` phase 4: when drafting a tracker-bound FR, use the literal placeholder `<tracker-id>` (rendered as `STE-<N>` for Linear, `PROJ-<N>` for Jira) throughout the draft — AC prefixes, filename, plan-file row, prose cross-references. **Never guess** the next sequential tracker number; the allocator decides, not the implementer. The real ID is known only after `Provider.sync(spec)` / `upsertTicketMetadata(null, …)` returns; substitute the placeholder globally once the ID is assigned, then write the FR file. New `docs/spec-write-tracker-mode.md` § "Tracker ID Assignment Order" with a concrete worked example. `docs/patterns.md` Pattern: Tracker Mode Probe gains a short callout cross-referencing both skills. New prose-assertion test `tests/spec-write-placeholder-convention.test.ts` grep-gates the `<tracker-id>` + "never guess" invariants against both SKILL.md files, following the shape of the existing prose-gate tests (`linear-adapter-doc-markers.test.ts`, `implement-phase4-close.test.ts`). **Dogfood origin:** M19's `/spec-write` session drafted STE-65 ACs using `AC-STE-65.*` prefixes before the Linear ticket existed — same class of regression as M16's `FR-N` retirement. Mode: none is exempt (short-ULID tail is local-mint, collision-proof).
- **STE-67 — Hide full 26-char ULIDs from tracker-mode user-facing prose.** `adapters/linear.md` `ticket_description_template` rewritten to drop the (implicit historical) `**ULID:**` header; canonical form is now `"{fr_body}\n\n---\n\nSource: specs/frs/{tracker_id}.md"`. The retired `{fr_anchor}` substitution variable (served the v1 `specs/requirements.md#FR-N` back-link) is replaced by `{tracker_id}` routing readers to the file-per-FR spec file — the v1 monolithic-requirements layout has no v2 equivalent. `adapters/jira.md` and `adapters/_template.md` converge on the same substitution for cross-adapter consistency. New `/gate-check` probe #11 (tracker-mode only, `mode: none` skipped) greps `specs/plan/*.md` (active), the current CHANGELOG release section, and `README.md` for `fr_[0-9A-HJKMNP-TV-Z]{26}` — each hit → **GATE PASSED WITH NOTES** (warn-only, never fails the gate). `docs/patterns.md` Pattern: Tracker Mode Probe gains a "Full ULIDs are internal-only" callout: the 26-char ULID lives only in frontmatter `id:` and code-internal references (resolver, `Provider.getMetadata`, `findFRByTrackerRef`); tracker mode references FRs by tracker ID in prose; mode: none uses the 6-char short-ULID tail. New test `tests/tracker-mode-ulid-hygiene.test.ts` (4 tests) asserts the Linear adapter template frontmatter no longer contains `ULID`, the back-link points at `specs/frs/`, and `importFromTracker`'s `renderFRFile` body omits both `${p.id}` interpolation and the `fr_` ULID prefix literal. Archived content is exempt (pre-M19 archive prose is frozen — rewriting history isn't worth it). **User-facing impact:** new Linear/Jira ticket descriptions written by `Provider.sync(spec)` carry `Source: specs/frs/<tracker-id>.md` instead of the v1 anchor form; plan-file FR-list tables drop the ULID column; cosmetic cleanup only, zero functional behavior change. The 5 existing M19 Linear ticket descriptions (STE-63/64/65/66/67) still carry their original `**ULID:** fr_...` header blocks — AC-STE-67.2's one-shot `save_issue` rewrite is tracked as a follow-up, to be executed from a Linear-enabled `/implement` session (M19's implementation session had no Linear MCP configured).

### Changed

- **STE-64 — Additions to the Schema L contract.** `docs/patterns.md` Pattern: Tracker Mode Probe section documents `branch_template:` as an additive key alongside `mode`, `mcp_server`, `jira_ac_field`. `specs/requirements.md` NFR-4 table row for Schema L updated to enumerate all four keys. `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` comment block (the one `/setup` emits into when tracker mode is chosen) now advertises `branch_template:` with both mode defaults so downstream projects discover the key without reading the source.
- **STE-64 — `/setup` step 7c.** New one-time question "Branch-naming template? (default: `<default-for-mode>`)" asked after Schema L is drafted (or skipped for projects that elected `1. none` in step 7b). Empty response accepts the default; non-empty is stored verbatim. Skip condition: if CLAUDE.md already has `branch_template:` under `## Task Tracking`, don't re-ask. `/setup --migrate` preserves existing keys.

### Removed

- **STE-63 — PR garbage sweep.** 31 files removed from the M12–M18 accumulation: 10 README-only fixture scenario stubs (`capability-degradation`, `clean-sync`, `empty-ac`, `migration-atomicity-fail`, `migration-linear-to-jira`, `migration-none-to-linear`, `migration-tracker-to-none`, `spec-review-tracker-only-ac`, `tracker-edited-mid-session`, `tracker-only-ac`) that were created during M12 planning but never wired to any `.ts` test, 20 files under `tests/fixtures/migration/v1-to-v2/` (planned regression fixture for the v1→v2 migration tool that never got a harness), and 1 M18 one-shot migration script `scripts/rewrite-fr-filenames.ts` (referenced only by CHANGELOG — migration already shipped in v1.21.0). Single atomic commit. `/gate-check` passes post-sweep (303 → 303 tests; no deletion broke a test). Ripgrep sanity inside `plugins/` returns zero straggling references for every deleted basename (CHANGELOG mentions are historical and intentionally preserved). Exemption list (`CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, root `README.md`, and everything under `specs/frs/archive/` + `specs/plan/archive/`) untouched throughout. The sweep is explicitly **not** a reusable skill — one-time cleanup only, report lives in the PR description (not in the repo).

### Fixed

- **Root-spec hygiene baseline.** `specs/technical-spec.md` Schema L narrative paragraph dropped its `M18 STE-62` reference (replaced with the `v1.21.0` version pointer) so the STE-59 root-hygiene probe no longer flags archived-milestone leakage in live specs. Gitignored fix — local baseline only; this repo's `specs/` is not version-controlled.

## [1.21.0] — 2026-04-23 — "Filename Convention"

M18 swaps FR filenames to the human-facing identifier (tracker ID in tracker mode, short-ULID tail in `mode: none`), rewrites every existing archive to the new shape, and retires the documented-but-inert `active_ticket:` key. Three FRs (STE-60..STE-62).

### Added

- **STE-60 — `Provider.filenameFor(spec)`.** New method on the `Provider` interface; `LocalProvider` returns `<spec.id.slice(23, 29)>.md` (short-ULID tail, matching M16's AC-prefix rule) and `TrackerProvider` returns `<spec.tracker[driver.trackerKey]>.md` — falling back to the short-ULID form when the FR has no binding for the driver's tracker. `/spec-write` step 0b.2, `/implement` Phase 4 archival, `/spec-archive` single-FR + milestone-group paths, and `/setup --migrate` mode transitions all consume the new method instead of hard-coding `fr_<ULID>.md`. New test `tests/filename-convention.test.ts` covers both provider implementations plus `ShortUlidCollisionError` semantics under the new convention.
- **STE-60 — Mode-transition FR rename (`/setup --migrate`).** Every mode flip (`none ↔ tracker` / `tracker → tracker`) now re-computes `Provider.filenameFor(spec)` under the target mode and `git mv`s every active FR to its new name in the migration commit. Archive is untouched by mode transitions — pre-flip archives keep whatever shape they had at archival time. The only place skills rename FR files.
- **STE-61 — Strict filename-matches-frontmatter gate.** `/gate-check` v2 probe 1 flipped from the pre-M18 `filename ↔ id:` byte-equality check to `basename(file) == Provider.filenameFor(spec)`. Any legacy `fr_<ULID>.md` filename now fails the gate. New test `tests/resolver-single-pattern.test.ts` asserts the resolver refuses to find FRs by scanning when filenames don't match the tracker ID / short-ULID convention. Ripgrep gate `rg -n 'fr_[0-9A-HJKMNP-TV-Z]{26}\.md' plugins/ docs/ README.md specs/` returns zero matches (outside `CHANGELOG.md` + frozen byte-diff baseline fixtures).

### Changed

- **All 86 existing FR filenames rewritten.** Three active FRs + 83 archived FRs under `specs/frs/` (and `specs/frs/archive/`) are renamed to the new convention: tracker-bound → `<tracker-id>.md`, tracker-less → `<short-ULID>.md`. Frontmatter `id:` is unchanged (the full 26-char ULID stays as the stable collision-proof reference). The rewrite script is committed at `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/scripts/rewrite-fr-filenames.ts` for auditability.
- **`findFRByTrackerRef` collapsed to single-pattern.** The Phase 2 frontmatter-scan fallback introduced by STE-60 (transitional — tolerated pre-M18 ULID filenames during the rewrite window) is removed. The resolver now only reads `<specsDir>/frs/<trackerId>.md` (+ the archive mirror). Filename / frontmatter disagreement returns null rather than papering over broken files. The previous dual-pattern test (`resolver-dual-pattern.test.ts`) is deleted and replaced by `resolver-single-pattern.test.ts`.
- **`LocalProvider.getFrPath` updated.** Only consults `<short-ULID>.md` paths; the legacy `<id>.md` candidates are gone.
- **Pattern 23 renamed** from "ULID File-per-FR Layout" to "File-per-FR Layout" with a `Superseded-by M18 STE-60` note on the filename-keying rule. The rest of the pattern (stable ULID in frontmatter, stem preserved across archival, tracker refs as attributes) is unchanged.
- **v2-layout reference, sdd-methodology, skill-anatomy, adaptation-guide, resolver-entry, spec-review-tracker-mode, implement-reference, patterns, and the CLAUDE.md template** all refreshed to describe the new convention. Tree diagrams show `STE-42.md` / `VDTAF4.md` instead of `fr_01HZ7XJFKP.....md`.
- **STE-62 — `active_ticket:` retired from Schema L.** The documented-but-unwired Tier-2 fallback key is removed from the root `CLAUDE.md`, the `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`, and all three resolver fixture `CLAUDE.md` files (`linear-only`, `linear-and-jira`, `overlapping-prefixes`). `docs/ticket-binding.md` rewritten from the 3-tier resolver to a 2-tier (branch regex → interactive prompt); the old Tier-2 / Tier-1 conflict section is gone. `docs/patterns.md` Pattern 6, `docs/spec-review-tracker-mode.md`, `docs/implement-tracker-mode.md`, `docs/tracker-adapters.md`, `docs/setup-tracker-mode.md`, `specs/technical-spec.md` §7.3, `specs/requirements.md` edge-case table, `tests/scripts/verify-regression.test.ts` synthetic data, and the three fixture project READMEs (`migration-none-to-linear`, `clean-sync`, `spec-review-tracker-only-ac`) are all scrubbed of the literal key. Ripgrep gate `rg -n 'active_ticket' plugins/ specs/ CLAUDE.md` returns zero matches outside the M18 plan / STE-62 FR / archived history. **User-facing impact:** any downstream project that manually set `active_ticket: <id>` in their own `CLAUDE.md` will now fall through to the interactive Tier-2 prompt instead of binding silently. Remedy: rename the branch to encode the ticket ID (the Tier-1 branch-regex path that actually works) — same remedy the old conflict message already suggested.

### Removed

- **Phase 2 frontmatter-scan fallback in `findFRByTrackerRef`.** See "changed" above — retired by STE-61 once the one-time rewrite landed.
- **Legacy `fr_<ULID>.md` filename regex in `/gate-check`.** Replaced by the strict `Provider.filenameFor(spec)` check.
- **The `active_ticket:` key from Schema L.** See STE-62 above.

## [1.20.0] — 2026-04-23 — "Fixes and Cleanup"

Two consumer-install bug fixes plus a four-item deletion sweep of shipped-but-unused surface, plus a new root-spec hygiene gate. Seven FRs (STE-53..STE-59).

**Release smoke-test (AC-STE-53.5):** in a fresh consumer install, verify that `/dev-process-toolkit:setup`, `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-write`, `/dev-process-toolkit:implement`, `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-archive`, and `/dev-process-toolkit:gate-check` each reach their bundled-helper invocation without silent fallthrough. All five now use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/_shared/...` invocation paths; the `skill-path-portability.test.ts` grep-gate prevents regressions. Prior to v1.20.0 these paths were bare `adapters/_shared/...`, which failed to resolve in consumer installs and silently degraded through NFR-10 / fallthrough branches.

### Added

- **STE-53 — Portable plugin-internal paths (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`).** Five `skills/*/SKILL.md` files (implement, spec-write, spec-archive, gate-check, setup) now prefix every `bun run adapters/...` invocation with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/`. Claude Code substitutes the variable at shell-exec time — resolves to the installed plugin root in consumer installs, to the local `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/` in this repo. New test `tests/skill-path-portability.test.ts` grep-asserts every `bun run adapters/` occurrence carries the prefix; `docs/skill-anatomy.md` gains the convention paragraph.
- **STE-54 — Phase-4 close reliability.** `/implement` Phase 4 now has a single atomic Close procedure naming (in order) `git commit` → `Provider.releaseLock` → `Provider.getTicketStatus` post-release verification. Any exit path that skips `releaseLock` or fails the `status_mapping.done` assertion surfaces an NFR-10-shape refusal and exits non-zero. New `Provider.getTicketStatus` method: `LocalProvider` returns the `"local-no-tracker"` sentinel; `TrackerProvider` delegates to the adapter driver's `getTicketStatus` and returns the canonical status string verbatim. `/gate-check` gains a "Ticket-state drift" check that walks `specs/frs/archive/` and asserts every bound ticket has reached the adapter's `status_mapping.done` — the read-side backstop. Linear adapter gains the `read_status` capability string. Two test files: `tests/implement-phase4-close.test.ts` (prose assertions on the Close structure) and `tests/gate-check-ticket-state-drift.test.ts` (drift-check prose + `LocalProvider`/`TrackerProvider.getTicketStatus` unit tests against a mocked driver). Formalizes the "After Phase 4 commit, move tickets to Done via releaseLock" memory into SKILL.md prose + tests + gate.
- **STE-59 — Root spec-file hygiene — cleanup + gate.** Part 1: `specs/requirements.md` §1 Overview refreshed (`v1.19.0` / `M17` in-flight), §4 Edge Cases and §5 Out-of-Scope orphan milestone-scoped headers relabeled topic-scoped ("Parallel-safe layout edge cases", "Tracker-native entry out-of-scope", etc.); `specs/technical-spec.md` Schema Q/T placeholders use generic `M<N>` / `plan/M<N>-kickoff`; `specs/testing-spec.md` milestone-framed fixture notes rewritten. Part 2: new `/gate-check` probe 10 "Root spec hygiene" with two sub-checks — **(a)** milestone-ID leakage detector (grep `\bM\d+\b` in the three root specs, walk to the containing heading, skip allowlist (`Shipped milestones` / `Archived context` / `Shipped releases` / `Release notes` / `Release history`), flag any remaining match whose `specs/plan/archive/M<N>.md` exists); **(b)** version/status freshness detector (compare `requirements.md` §1 `Latest shipped release` against `plugin.json` version; verify in-flight milestone if named resolves to a live `specs/plan/M<N>.md`). New helper `adapters/_shared/src/root_hygiene.ts`, new test `tests/gate-check-root-hygiene.test.ts` (positive + negative fixtures + repo self-check), new `docs/patterns.md` § "Root Spec Hygiene" section. Motivated by the post-M12–M16 drift report (`/tmp/dpt-drift-2026-04-23.md`) surfacing that root specs had quietly accumulated milestone-framed language across three years of milestones. The gate makes the "root specs stay shape-only, current-only" invariant enforceable rather than aspirational.

### Removed

- **STE-55 — v1→v2 migrator.** Deleted the self-contained migrator module at `adapters/_shared/src/migrate/` (11 files — `index.ts` + `split_fr.ts` + `split_plan.ts` + `colocate.ts` + `convert_archive.ts` + `attribution.ts` + each of their `.test.ts` counterparts), `docs/setup-migrate.md`, and 6 migration tests (`tests/setup-migrate-*.test.ts`, `tests/setup-migration-detection.test.ts`). `skills/setup/SKILL.md` § 0b now only routes into tracker-mode migration — there is no v1→v2 path. v2 is the baseline; no v1 projects remain in production use. Ripgrep gate: `rg -n 'v1→v2|v1->v2|migrate/index|setup-migrate|migrateV1ToV2' plugins/` returns zero matches (excluding CHANGELOG + archived FRs).
- **STE-56 — `specs/.dpt-layout` + layout probes.** Deleted `specs/.dpt-layout`, `adapters/_shared/src/layout.ts` + test, `adapters/_shared/schemas/layout.schema.json`. Removed the "Layout probe" step-0 block from all five spec-touching skills (implement, spec-write, spec-archive, gate-check, setup) and from `/spec-review` — each now proceeds assuming v2 unconditionally. Brainstorm deferred decision #3 resolved: full-delete over retain-as-v3-guard (speculative). Ripgrep gate: `rg -n '\.dpt-layout|layout\.ts|[Ll]ayout probe|versionGate' plugins/ specs/` returns zero matches.
- **STE-57 — `specs/INDEX.md` + `regenerateIndex` helper.** Deleted `specs/INDEX.md`, `adapters/_shared/src/index_gen.ts` + test, `adapters/_shared/schemas/index.schema.json`. Removed `regenerateIndex(specsDir)` call sites from `/implement` Phase 4, `/spec-write` step 0b.5, `/spec-archive` step 4–5, and `importFromTracker`. Humans browse `specs/frs/*.md` directly; Linear's UI is the authoritative active-FR index in tracker mode. Per-unit `archive/index.md` files under `specs/frs/archive/` and `specs/plan/archive/` are explicitly preserved (different purpose, separate lifecycle). Ripgrep gate: `rg -n 'INDEX\.md|regenerateIndex' plugins/ specs/ CLAUDE.md` returns zero matches.
- **STE-58 — `### Sync log` subsection + `sync_log.ts` helper.** Deleted `adapters/_shared/src/sync_log.ts` + test. Removed the `### Sync log` subsection from `CLAUDE.md` + `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`. Simplified `resolver_config.ts`'s Schema L parser — no more sync-log exclusion logic (parser stops at any `## ` / `### ` heading, which is sufficient now that the subsection is gone). Removed sync-log append sites from `/setup`, `/spec-write`, and the tracker-mode migration flow. ADR added to `docs/patterns.md` § "Audit trail" documenting the tradeoff: `git log` is the authoritative audit trail; `git blame` on the specific FR file recovers per-AC resolution detail when needed. The FR-39 bidirectional AC sync mechanism is preserved unchanged — only the redundant audit emission is gone. Ripgrep gate: `rg -n 'sync_log|### Sync log|Sync log' plugins/ CLAUDE.md specs/` returns zero matches.

### Changed

- **Provider interface.** `Provider.getTicketStatus(ticketId: string): Promise<{ status: string }>` added to `adapters/_shared/src/provider.ts`; `technical-spec.md` §4 Architectural Contracts updated to match.
- **`frontmatter.ts` header comment.** Removed references to the deleted `index_gen` and `migrate` modules — the parser is now used by `local_provider`, `plan_lock`, and `resolver_config` only.
- **`import.ts`.** `importFromTracker` no longer calls `regenerateIndex` after the FR write + sync. The `specsDir` argument is still required for path construction.
- **`verify-regression.ts` Schema M probe.** No longer checks `specs/.dpt-layout` existence — the fixture marker is gone. The `mode-none-v2-migration.snapshot` baseline has been regenerated to reflect the deleted `INDEX.md` and `.dpt-layout`.
- **`schemas.test.ts`.** Schema-count assertion now expects 3 files (`fr.schema.json`, `lock.schema.json`, `plan.schema.json`) — down from 5. Layout and index schemas are gone.
- **`tracker_provider.ts` + `local_provider.ts`.** Both implement the new `getTicketStatus`. `LocalProvider` returns the `"local-no-tracker"` sentinel without touching the filesystem. `TrackerProvider` resolves the input as a ULID or already-tracker-ref, calls the driver's `getTicketStatus`, and returns the status string.

### Fixed

- **Pre-v1.17.0 regression:** plugin-internal helper paths have not resolved in consumer installs since v1.17.0 — every `bun run adapters/_shared/...` invocation silently failed, and skills degraded through NFR-10 / fallthrough branches without a visible error. STE-53 fixes the five SKILL.md files; `skill-path-portability.test.ts` prevents future regressions.
- **Phase-4 releaseLock drop:** `/implement` Phase 4 non-deterministically dropped `Provider.releaseLock`, leaving Linear tickets at `In Progress` after ship. STE-54's atomic Close step + the `/gate-check` ticket-state drift detector close the loop.

## [1.19.0] — 2026-04-22 — "FR Identity Stability"

Retires the scan-and-increment `FR-<N>` identifier in favor of collision-proof AC prefixes: the bound tracker ID in tracker mode (`AC-STE-50.1`), or the last 6 chars of the FR's ULID random portion in `mode: none` (`AC-VDTAF4.1`). The brainstorm question that motivated the milestone — *"is FR-N safe under concurrent FR creation across parallel branches?"* — answered no: FR-N was the one identifier derived from "scan + next-free-number," the classic race-condition shape. ULIDs (file identity) and server-allocated tracker IDs are collision-proof by construction; M16 brings AC prefixes and FR-facing references under the same rule.

The tail slice of the random portion (`slice(23, 29)`) is chosen deliberately over the head (`slice(13, 19)`): `ulid.ts` implements monotonic ULIDs — within the same millisecond, randomness is incremented at the least-significant byte, so burst mints share the leading random chars but differ in the tail (observed in this repo's own `fr_01KPTSA7W8N116XWSXXE0G1PY3` and `…PY4`, which share `slice(13, 19) == "N116XW"` but differ in `slice(23, 29)`). This spec deviation from the original M16 brainstorm (AC-STE-50.2) was caught during Phase A TDD and resolved before any code was written.

No behavior changes for `mode: none` projects aside from the new short-ULID AC-prefix form for **newly created** FRs — existing FRs in external projects keep their legacy `AC-<N>.M` prefixes (no backfill). The one-off purge of legacy references (STE-51) runs only on this repo.

### Added

- **STE-50 — Collision-proof AC prefixes.** New helper `acPrefix(spec)` in `adapters/_shared/src/ac_prefix.ts` derives the AC-prefix segment from an FR's frontmatter: in tracker mode, returns the first non-null tracker ID from the `tracker:` block (e.g., `STE-50`); in `mode: none`, returns `spec.id.slice(23, 29)` — the monotonic tail of the ULID's random portion (e.g., `VDTAF4`). `ShortUlidCollisionError` and a pre-write `scanShortUlidCollision(specsDir, spec)` abort `mode: none` writes that would collide with an existing FR's short-ULID tail (AC-STE-50.3). Tracker-bound FRs bypass the scan since tracker IDs are collision-proof by the allocator. The helper is wired into `importFromTracker` (tracker-imported FRs now emit `- AC-<TRACKER_ID>.<N>:` lines, AC-STE-50.1) and documented in `/spec-write` step 0b.
- **STE-50 — `ac_lint` module.** `adapters/_shared/src/ac_lint.ts` walks every active `specs/frs/*.md` (excluding `archive/`), extracts each `## Acceptance Criteria` section, and reports any `AC-<prefix>.<N>` pair appearing more than once within a single file. Added as v2 conformance probe #9 in `/gate-check`; cross-file duplicates are allowed (different FRs can legitimately share the same `.N` suffix).

### Changed

- **STE-51 — In-repo rewrite.** One-off mechanical rewrite of every legacy `FR-<N>` heading, `{#FR-N}` anchor, `AC-<N>.<M>` prefix, and prose citation across `specs/frs/`, `specs/plan/`, `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/`, `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/skills/`, and `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/tests/` to the STE-50-derived prefix form. `CHANGELOG.md`, git commit history, top-level `README.md`, and anything under `specs/**/archive/` remain as historical record. Post-rewrite `rg '\bFR-\d+\b'` over the non-archive surface returns zero matches; the `ac_lint` duplicate-AC probe returns zero matches across the rewritten files. No reusable migration skill is packaged — the plugin has no external adopters yet, so a throwaway rewrite suffices.

### Removed

- **STE-52 — `findFRByFRCode` resolver branch.** `findFRByFRCode`, `FR_CODE_RE`, the `FRCode` type, the `kind: "fr-code"` branch, and `AmbiguousArgumentKind` are gone from `adapters/_shared/src/resolve.ts`; `ResolveKind` narrows to `ulid | tracker-id | url | fallthrough`. Passing a literal `FR-<N>` argument to `/spec-write`, `/implement`, or `/spec-archive` now resolves as `fallthrough` (skill-specific handling per pre-M14 contract). The FR-69 resolver test block and the `tests/fixtures/resolver/fr-code-lookup/` fixture are deleted; a replacement regression test in `resolve.test.ts` locks the branch removal. `docs/resolver-entry.md` decision table loses the `fr-code` row. `rg -n 'fr-code|FRCode|findFRByFRCode|FR_CODE_RE' plugins/` returns zero matches.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-04-22 — "Migration Hardening"

Tightens every surface that M13 (`/setup --migrate`) + M14 (tracker-native entry) shipped. M15 is a **dogfooding milestone**: running `/setup --migrate none → linear` against the plugin's own repo, then `/implement` against the resulting Linear tickets, surfaced 14 concrete doc-code gaps that the earlier milestones had not exercised end-to-end. Each gap became a dedicated FR filed as `Finding #N of M`, bundled into one "Hardening" milestone rather than drip-fed across patch releases. A 15th FR (this one — FR-64) carries the release work.

The headline user-visible changes: migration now walks the v2 layout (`specs/frs/`, not just v1's `specs/requirements.md`), writes tracker bindings to FR frontmatter in the canonical multi-line form, populates Linear's native project-milestone field, prompts for initial ticket state instead of defaulting silently to Backlog, and regenerates `INDEX.md` after any frontmatter write. Under the hood, `TrackerProvider` now detects Linear's silent-no-op write behavior (where `save_issue` returns a successful-looking payload for unknown keys), a shared `buildResolverConfig()` removes inline config assembly from every tracker-aware skill, and `/implement` Phase 4 releases the tracker lock on FR-scope runs instead of leaving tickets In Progress.

No behavior changes for `mode: none` projects — Pattern 9 mode-none byte-for-byte regression preserved across all 3 baselines.

### Added

- **Shared `buildResolverConfig()` loader** (FR-65 / AC-65.1..8): `adapters/_shared/src/resolver_config.ts` — single entry point that reads `CLAUDE.md` `mcp_server:` + adapter Schema W frontmatter and assembles the `ResolverConfig` every tracker-aware skill (`/spec-write`, `/implement`, `/spec-archive`) hands to `resolveFRArgument`. Eliminates the three inline config-assembly sites that M14 shipped; adapter-metadata errors now surface once as `MalformedAdapterMetadataError` in NFR-10 canonical shape instead of three silently diverging constructions.
- **Resolver FR-N code route** (FR-69 / AC-69.1..6): `resolveFRArgument` now accepts bare `FR-<N>` codes (e.g., `FR-42`) by scanning FR files' AC prefixes (`AC-<N>.*`) for a match. `{kind: 'fr-code', ulid}` on hit, `AmbiguousFRCodeError` (NFR-20 shape) if multiple active FRs share the number, `FRCodeNotFoundError` (NFR-10 shape) on miss. Enables `/implement FR-42` and `/spec-archive FR-42` as first-class arguments alongside ULIDs, tracker IDs, and URLs.
- **Linear `save_issue` silent no-op guard** (FR-67 / AC-67.1..6): `TrackerProvider.claimLock` + `releaseLock` now call `verifyWriteLanded(trackerRef, preUpdatedAt, operation)` after every `transition_status` + `upsert_ticket_metadata` call. If the post-write `updatedAt` didn't advance past the pre-call value, the write silently no-op'd (unknown-key echo) — surfaces as `TrackerWriteNoOpError` with NFR-10 canonical shape. Opt-in per adapter: drivers declaring `updatedAt` in `TicketStatusSummary` engage the guard; adapters that don't degrade gracefully.
- **Pattern 25: Dogfooding Discovery** (FR-64 / AC-64.5): `docs/patterns.md` gains a new entry capturing the M15 methodology — run the plugin on its own repo, log every judgment-call / workaround as an NFR-10-shape deviation, file each deviation as a dedicated FR with `Finding #N of M`, bundle into one hardening milestone. The pattern is the canonical escape hatch when doc-drift exceeds patch-release scope.
- **Gate probe: stale release marker scan** (FR-62 AC-62.5): `/gate-check` greps `specs/requirements.md` for `(in flight — v<X.Y.Z>)` / `(planned — v<X.Y.Z>)` markers whose CHANGELOG entry has already shipped, emits **GATE PASSED WITH NOTES** so the operator can rewrite the overview to past-tense. Catches the "changelog-by-accident" rot observed 2026-04-22.
- **Gate probe: per-milestone heading strip** (FR-63 AC-63.6): `/gate-check` greps `specs/technical-spec.md` and `specs/testing-spec.md` for `^#{1,3} M\d+` matches — any hit is **GATE FAILED** with a pointer to AC-40.3 (post-migration cross-cutting files must carry zero per-milestone headings).

### Changed

- **`/setup --migrate` detection** (FR-56 / AC-56.1..4): detection rule now covers the `mode: none → <tracker>` path explicitly. The SKILL.md:33 exclusion has been replaced with a mode-transition table enumerating every supported pair (`none → <tracker>`, `<tracker> → none`, `<tracker> → <other>`). Previously, migrating out of `mode: none` hit the migration-unsupported branch despite the procedure doc supporting it.
- **v2 layout-aware FR iteration** (FR-57 / AC-57.1..5): the `none → <tracker>` procedure now reads `specs/.dpt-layout` and branches iteration accordingly — `readdirSync(specsDir + '/frs')` on v2, `### FR-{N}:` blocks in `specs/requirements.md` on v1. Empty-tree refusal (both markers absent) surfaces the NFR-10 canonical shape with a `/setup` remedy pointer. Structured count summary + explicit user confirm precede any `upsert_ticket_metadata` call (AC-57.4).
- **Canonical tracker-binding writes** (FR-58 / AC-58.1..5): `setTrackerBinding(frFileContents, trackerKey, ticketId)` in `adapters/_shared/src/frontmatter.ts` writes the canonical multi-line `tracker:\n  <key>: <id>` form. Existing `tracker:` entries preserved alphabetically so `<tracker> → <other>` migrations merge instead of overwriting. Frontmatter-write failure after a successful push surfaces NFR-10 partial-failure shape listing un-bound FRs (tickets created, frontmatter NOT updated) so the operator can reverse before the CLAUDE.md `mode:` line is touched (atomicity AC-36.7 extended through step 4).
- **Linear project-milestone population on migration** (FR-59 / AC-59.1..3): adapters declaring `project_milestone: true` (Linear) now resolve each distinct `milestone: M<N>` to a tracker-milestone whose name starts with `M<N>` (case-sensitive, exact-prefix) on the configured project. Missing tracker-milestones prompt once per `M<N>` with [1] Create / [2] Skip / [3] Cancel. Adapters with `project_milestone: false` (Jira, `_template`) log one surprise-guard line and skip. Previously, shipped projects lost their milestone taxonomy on migration.
- **Initial ticket state prompt on migration** (FR-60 / AC-60.1..5): migration now prompts once before the bulk push: `[1] Backlog (new work) / [2] Done (shipped work) / [3] In Progress (in flight) / [4] ask per-FR. Default 1.` The chosen canonical state is resolved via the adapter's `status_mapping` (Schema M doubles as initial-state allowlist — unknown state fails the prompt with NFR-10 shape naming valid options). Option 4 defaults per-FR to frontmatter `status:` (`active → Backlog`, `in_progress → In Progress`). Sync-log records `(initial state: <Name>)` or `(initial state: per-FR)` so the log shows the choice was deliberate.
- **`INDEX.md` regeneration on migration** (FR-61 / AC-61.1..5): `/setup --migrate` now calls `regenerateIndex(specsDir)` inside the atomicity boundary after any frontmatter write (both directions). Required by FR-40 AC-40.4; previously, migration wrote N bindings and left INDEX stale.
- **`requirements.md` overview refresh** (FR-62 / AC-62.1..5): shipped releases now appear past-tense in the overview; in-flight markers were stripped. Gate probe (AC-62.5, listed under Added above) enforces the new discipline on future releases.
- **Cross-cutting spec files slimmed** (FR-63 / AC-63.1..6): the v1→v2 migration tool previously left per-milestone blocks in `specs/technical-spec.md` (1213 lines) and `specs/testing-spec.md` (578 lines), violating AC-40.3. Per-milestone content moved into `specs/frs/<ulid>.md` / `specs/plan/<M#>.md`; cross-cutting files now carry only cross-cutting content. Gate probe (AC-63.6, listed under Added above) enforces.
- **`updatedAt` recording timing** (FR-66 / AC-66.1..5): `/implement` Phase 1 step 0.d now records the ticket's `updatedAt` **after** `claimLock` has succeeded, not at skill entry. Recording earlier caused `/gate-check` Phase 4 drift probe to flag the skill's own claimLock write as external drift (dogfood-observed 2026-04-22). Rule applies to any tracker-writing pre-flight step.
- **`/implement` Phase 4 releaseLock on FR-scope runs** (FR-68 / AC-68.1..4): FR-scope runs (`/implement STE-43`, `/implement fr_…`) now call `Provider.releaseLock(id)` after commit approval, moving the tracker ticket to Done. Previously, releaseLock only fired during milestone archival, leaving FR-scope-completed tickets stranded In Progress.
- **`resolver_config` replaces inline assembly** in `/spec-write`, `/implement`, `/spec-archive` (FR-65 AC-65.5): all three skills now call `buildResolverConfig(claudeMdPath, adaptersDir)` at entry. The Linear adapter doc, Jira adapter doc, and `_template` adapter doc no longer have to document the config shape separately — Schema W is the single declaration surface.
- **Linear adapter doc** (FR-67 / AC-67.1, AC-67.4): `adapters/linear.md` now documents `state` (not `status`) and `assignee` (not `assigneeId`/`assigneeEmail`) as the canonical `save_issue` parameters, with a "Silent no-op trap" warning box and cross-reference to `TrackerWriteNoOpError`.

### Fixed

- **FR-56 / STE-35** — `/setup --migrate` correctly handles `mode: none → <tracker>` (previously hit migration-unsupported branch).
- **FR-58 / STE-37** — migration writes tracker bindings to FR frontmatter in canonical form (previously skipped on v2).
- **FR-60 / STE-39** — migration no longer defaults silently to Backlog (prompts for initial state).
- **FR-61 / STE-40** — INDEX.md regenerated after migration frontmatter writes (previously stale).
- **FR-66 / STE-45** — `/gate-check` no longer flags `/implement`'s own claimLock write as external drift.
- **FR-67 / STE-46** — Linear `save_issue` silent-no-op writes (unknown keys) surfaced as `TrackerWriteNoOpError` instead of falsely treated as successful.
- **FR-68 / STE-47** — FR-scope `/implement` runs releaseLock the ticket on completion (previously stranded In Progress).

### Removed

- **v1 `specs/archive/` path purged** (FR-70 / AC-70.1..5): README, three docs (`sdd-methodology.md`, `adaptation-guide.md`, `skill-anatomy.md`), three skills (`implement`, `spec-archive`, `spec-write`), and the cross-cutting live specs all referenced the dead v1 archive path (flat `specs/archive/M<N>-<slug>.md` + rolling `index.md`). FR-45 superseded it with per-unit archives at `specs/frs/archive/<ulid>.md` + `specs/plan/archive/<M#>.md`. Every reference rewritten to the v2 path; Schema G / Schema H / "traceability matrix" vocabulary replaced with FR-45 frontmatter-flip language.

### Cross-references

FRs: FR-56..FR-70 (15 FRs, ~80 ACs across Phase A skill+resolver fixes, Phase B adapter extensions, Phase C cross-cutting cleanup, Phase D release). M15 plan: `specs/plan/archive/M15.md`. Dogfood findings: 14 (#1..#14) plus the release FR. Total test count at release: 315 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-04-21 — "Tracker-native Entry"

Accepts tracker IDs (`LIN-1234`, `PROJ-42`, `#982`) and full tracker URLs as first-class arguments to `/spec-write`, `/implement`, and `/spec-archive`. A shared resolver at each skill's entry detects the argument kind (ULID / tracker-ID / URL / fallthrough) and routes through a single code path; a shared import helper handles the "tracker ref with no local FR yet" case so the three skills cannot drift. Tracker teams no longer need to look up an internal ULID to work on a ticket whose "real" ID is `LIN-1234` — the plugin accepts what they already know.

Pre-M14 argument forms continue unchanged: ULIDs, milestone codes (`M12`), anchors (`{#M3}`, `{#FR-7}`), and keywords (`all`, `requirements`, `technical`, `testing`, `plan`) all fall through to their pre-existing handlers byte-for-byte (NFR-18).

### Added

- **Resolver utility** (FR-51 / AC-51.1..9): `adapters/_shared/src/resolve.ts` — `resolveFRArgument(arg, config)` returns `{kind: 'ulid' | 'tracker-id' | 'url' | 'fallthrough', …}` via deterministic string parsing + config lookup (pure function, no I/O — NFR-17). `findFRByTrackerRef(specsDir, trackerKey, trackerId, {includeArchive?})` scans `specs/frs/**` frontmatter for a matching `tracker.<key>: <id>` and returns the ULID or null; archive excluded by default. Ordering: explicit-prefix → ULID → URL → tracker-ID → fallthrough (§9.4). Ambiguity across configured trackers throws `AmbiguousArgumentError` with both `<tracker>:<id>` candidates — never silently picks a winner (NFR-20).
- **Import helper** (FR-52/FR-53 shared): `adapters/_shared/src/import.ts` — `importFromTracker(trackerKey, trackerId, provider, specsDir, promptMilestone)` mints a ULID, writes `specs/frs/<ulid>.md` with tracker ACs auto-accepted (no FR-39 per-AC prompt loop on initial import — AC-52.5), calls `Provider.sync`, and regenerates `INDEX.md`. Empty-AC tickets get a TODO marker under `## Acceptance Criteria` (AC-52.7).
- **Schema W adapter metadata**: `resolver:` frontmatter block on `adapters/{linear,jira,_template}.md` declaring `id_pattern`, `url_host`, and `url_path_regex`. Adapter authors opt in to auto-resolution by adding this block; adapters omitting it continue to work via ULID-only arguments.
- **`/spec-write` tracker import** (FR-52 / AC-52.1..8): resolver at entry after FR-47 layout gate; tracker-id/url + find hit → edit existing, no import; miss → `importFromTracker` with auto-accepted ACs; fallthrough → pre-M14 free-form handling unchanged.
- **`/implement` tracker-ID entry** (FR-53 / AC-53.1..7): resolver between Provider resolution (FR-43) and `Provider.claimLock` (FR-46); tracker-id/url + miss → `importFromTracker` then lock claim; branch-name interop (FR-32) — argument wins with NFR-10-shape warning when branch name disagrees (AC-53.5).
- **`/spec-archive` tracker-ID resolution** (FR-54 / AC-54.1..6): resolver at entry; tracker-id/url + hit → archive via `git mv` + status flip on resolved ULID; miss → refuse with NFR-10 canonical error (never auto-imports — AC-54.4); milestone codes (`M12`), anchors, and heading strings fall through unchanged.
- **Documentation** (FR-55 / AC-55.1..5): `docs/patterns.md` § Pattern 24 "Tracker-ID Auto-Resolution" (user-facing story + decision table); `docs/tracker-adapters.md` § "Registering tracker ID patterns for the resolver" (Schema W reference + custom-adapter example); `docs/resolver-entry.md` (canonical per-skill decision table — referenced from each skill to keep them under the NFR-1 300-line cap).
- **Regression fixtures**: `tests/fixtures/resolver/{linear-only,linear-and-jira,overlapping-prefixes,no-trackers}/` — four paired `CLAUDE.md` + `specs/frs/` trees covering AC-51.2..7 configuration combinations. Integration tests exercise resolver + `findFRByTrackerRef` against each.

### Changed

- `plugin.json` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` version → `1.17.0`.
- `README.md` Latest: line → `v1.17.0 — "Tracker-native Entry"`.
- `/spec-write`, `/implement`, and `/spec-archive` each gained one resolver entry step (step 0a or 0.b′) before any side effect; v1-layout and fallthrough argument paths remain byte-identical.

### Known follow-ups

- **Tier 5 manual walkthrough** (AC-55.1 verify bullet): the live-Linear end-to-end walk documented in the M14 plan is deferred pending a configured Linear workspace — same precedent as M12's Tier 5 deferral documented in the v1.15.0 release. Executing `/spec-write https://linear.app/<workspace>/issue/<real-ticket>/...` against a real workspace remains post-ship verification work. **Status update from v1.18.0:** M15's dogfooding milestone exercised the `/setup --migrate` and `/implement` surfaces against a live Linear workspace end-to-end, which is adjacent to the Tier 5 target and surfaced the 14 gaps M15 closed.

### Cross-references

FRs: FR-51..FR-55 (5 FRs, ~32 ACs). NFRs: NFR-17..NFR-21. Design: `technical-spec.md` §9. Test strategy: `testing-spec.md` §8. Total M14 shared-adapter test count: 51 new tests (42 resolve + 9 import); full shared-adapter suite: 155 tests, 0 failures.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-04-21 — "Parallel-safe"

Restructures `specs/` from the monolithic 4-file layout (v1) to a file-per-FR + ULID layout (v2). Introduces a typed `Provider` interface that unifies ID lifecycle and tracker sync behind one contract, so skills never branch on "tracker configured vs. not." Eliminates the three merge-collision classes (ID, content, archival-hotspot) that made parallel-branch spec edits painful under v1. Ships with `/setup --migrate` as the one-way v1 → v2 path, backed by a backup tag, dry-run preview, clean-tree precondition, and two-commit sequence.

**Migration is explicit user invocation only.** Existing v1 projects continue to work unchanged — every spec-touching skill starts with a layout probe that falls through to v1 behavior when `specs/.dpt-layout` is absent. Pattern 9 byte-for-byte regression is preserved across all 3 mode-none baselines.

### Added

- **v2 spec tree** (FR-40 / AC-40.1..5): `specs/frs/<ulid>.md` per FR (active) with `specs/frs/archive/<ulid>.md` (archived), `specs/plan/<M#>.md` per milestone, generated `specs/INDEX.md` (deterministic, sort: milestone ASC → status → ULID ASC), `specs/.dpt-layout` YAML marker.
- **ULID minter** (FR-41 / AC-41.1..5): `adapters/_shared/src/ulid.ts`. `fr_` prefix + Crockford base32 (26 chars, excludes I/L/O/U). Monotonic within-millisecond, random across processes, always local (no network). NODE_ENV=test + DPT_TEST_ULID_SEED produces a deterministic sequence (AC-39.11 discipline). Filename ↔ `id:` frontmatter equality enforced by `/gate-check` conformance probe (NFR-15 invariants 1+2).
- **Provider interface** (FR-42, FR-43 / AC-42.1..5, AC-43.1..6): `adapters/_shared/src/provider.ts` — `mintId/getMetadata/sync/getUrl/claimLock/releaseLock`. Two implementations ship: `LocalProvider` (tracker-less, `.dpt-locks/` + remote scan) and `TrackerProvider` (composes over M12 adapter surface with injectable `AdapterDriver`).
- **Per-milestone plan files + kickoff discipline** (FR-44 / AC-44.1..6): `specs/plan/<M#>.md` with Schema T frontmatter (`milestone, status, kickoff_branch, frozen_at, revision`). Once `status: active`, edits require a sanctioned `plan/<M#>-replan-<N>` branch. `adapters/_shared/src/plan_lock.ts` exports `checkPlanWriteAllowed` + `findPostFreezeEdits` for `/gate-check` probe wiring.
- **Move-based archival** (FR-45 / AC-45.1..6): `/implement` Phase 4 and `/spec-archive` both use `git mv specs/frs/<ulid>.md specs/frs/archive/<ulid>.md` + frontmatter `status` flip in a single atomic commit. Milestone-level archival performs N moves + N flips + plan-file move in one commit.
- **One-ticket-one-branch enforcement** (FR-46 / AC-46.1..7): `Provider.claimLock/releaseLock` at `/implement` entry/exit. Tracker mode strict (status + assignee); tracker-less mode best-effort (`.dpt-locks/` + `git fetch --all` cross-branch scan). `DPT_SKIP_FETCH=1` escape hatch documented.
- **Layout version gate** (FR-47 / AC-47.1..5): `adapters/_shared/src/layout.ts` `readLayoutVersion(specsDir, {allowMissing?})`. `/setup` exempt via `allowMissing: true`. Mismatch → canonical message: `"Layout v<actual> detected; <skill> requires v2. Run /dev-process-toolkit:setup to migrate."`
- **Migration tooling** (FR-48 / AC-48.1..13, NFR-14): `adapters/_shared/src/migrate/{split_fr,colocate,split_plan,convert_archive,index}.ts`. `/setup --migrate` + `--migrate-dry-run` flags. Clean-tree precondition, `dpt-v1-snapshot-<ts>` backup tag, memory-staged transform (all writes computed in RAM before any filesystem mutation), two-commit sequence (`feat(specs): migrate to v2 layout` + `chore(specs): record v2 layout marker`), structured summary (FR count / milestone count / archive count / tag). Idempotent on already-v2 trees. **Recoverability, not strict atomicity**: a failure after the write phase but before commit 2 leaves the working tree in partial-v2 state; users recover via `git reset --hard <backup-tag>`. The backup tag is the always-available rollback path. Graceful degradation for gitignored-specs/ repos (filesystem-only path, no backup tag — that path is for repos where specs/ history is not tracked at all).
- **v2 skill retrofit** (FR-49 / AC-49.1..8): 6 spec-touching skills (`/setup`, `/spec-write`, `/implement`, `/gate-check`, `/spec-archive`, `/spec-review`) gained layout + Provider probes. Read-only skills (`/brainstorm`, `/tdd`, `/simplify`, `/debug`, `/pr`, `/visual-check`) verified layout-agnostic via regression fixture.
- **JSON Schema files** — `adapters/_shared/schemas/{fr,layout,lock,plan,index}.schema.json` (Schemas Q–U as machine-readable JSON Schema; canonical examples live in `technical-spec.md` §8.3).
- **Regression infrastructure** — `tests/fixtures/v2-minimal/` (golden v2 tree), `tests/fixtures/migration/v1-to-v2/{input,expected}/` (round-trip fixture with deterministic ULIDs), Schema M probe layer in `verify-regression.ts` (filename↔id equality, ULID regex, layout marker — AC-49.8).
- **Documentation** (FR-50 / AC-50.1..7): `docs/patterns.md` § Pattern 23 (ULID File-per-FR Layout), `docs/sdd-methodology.md` § Parallel-safe layout, `docs/v2-layout-reference.md` (canonical behavioral contract), `docs/tracker-adapters.md` § Provider Interface, `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` v2 tree description.

### Changed

- `plugin.json` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` version → `1.16.0`.
- `README.md` Latest: line → `v1.16.0 — "Parallel-safe"`.
- Skills' first steps now run a layout probe before tracker-mode probe; v1 path preserved byte-for-byte when `.dpt-layout` is absent (Pattern 9 invariant).

### Spec deviations documented

- **AC-44.2 vs AC-48.7** — migrated active plans have `kickoff_branch: null` + `frozen_at: null` (AC-48.7), while AC-44.2 says those fields are null only for `status: draft`. Resolution: `plan.schema.json` permissive (allOf enforces draft-only null case); migration exception documented in `$comment`. `/gate-check` enforces the tighter AC-44.2 invariant behaviorally for non-migrated plans.
- **AC-49.8 interpretation** — "byte-identical skill outputs against v2-minimal" is structurally validated (Schema M probe: layout marker, ULID regex, filename↔id equality, INDEX.md determinism) rather than by executing each of 12 markdown skills against the fixture. Skills are documentation-style `.md` files, not shell-executable primitives.

### Known follow-ups

- CHANGELOG date refresh at merge (this section's date stamp will update to the actual merge day; AC-50.4 placeholder).
- Regenerated-per-archive `specs/frs/archive/INDEX.md` not shipped (out of scope per technical-spec §8.11).

### Cross-references

## [1.15.0] — 2026-04-17 — "Tracker Integration"

Opt-in tracker mode (Linear, Jira, custom) for teams whose ACs live in a task tracker. Default `mode: none` is byte-identical to pre-M12 — Pattern 9 regression gate (`tests/fixtures/baselines/m1-m11-regression.snapshot`) is the stop-ship guardrail.

### Added

- **`## Task Tracking` section in `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` (FR-29 / AC-29.1..5, Schema L)** — Optional block gated behind an HTML comment so `mode: none` renders byte-identical to pre-M12. Section presence = canonical mode probe anchor (see `docs/patterns.md` § Tracker Mode Probe).
- **`plugins/dev-process-toolkit/adapters/` with three adapters (FR-31 / AC-31.1..6, FR-38 / AC-38.1..6):**
  - `_template.md` + `_template/src/stub.ts` — starting point for custom trackers.
  - `linear.md` + `linear/src/normalize.ts` — description-section storage, round-trip idempotence (AC-39.6, AC-37.5), 12 unit tests.
  - `jira.md` + `jira/src/discover_field.ts` — per-tenant custom-field GID discovery against `/rest/api/3/field` fixture (AC-30.6), 6 unit tests.
  - `_shared/src/{classify_diff,sync_log}.ts` — adapter-agnostic FR-39 diff classifier (Schema K) and AC-39.8 sync-log formatter (Schema L), 14 unit tests.
- **`docs/tracker-adapters.md`** — 4-op contract (`pull_acs`, `push_ac_toggle`, `transition_status`, `upsert_ticket_metadata`), Schemas L–P walkthrough, conformance checklist (Tier 5, 35+ items), capability-degradation reference table (FR-38 AC-38.6), Bun-runtime prerequisite section, worked custom-tracker example (FR-38 / AC-38.5).
- **`docs/patterns.md` § Tracker Mode Probe** — the canonical Schema L probe every mode-aware skill runs as its first action.
- **`docs/ticket-binding.md` (FR-32 / AC-32.1..5, Pattern 6)** — 3-tier resolver (branch regex → `active_ticket:` → interactive prompt), mandatory confirmation, conflict handling, URL-paste fallback for custom adapters.
- **`docs/fr-39-sync.md` (FR-39 / AC-39.1..10)** — diff classifier + per-AC prompt (4 options, no bulk shortcuts per AC-39.7) + two-side convergence + sync-log append + cancel semantics + round-trip idempotence.
- **`docs/setup-tracker-mode.md` (FR-30 / AC-30.1..9)** — mode question + Bun check + Linear V1 SSE→V2 migration + `claude mcp list` detection + dry-run `settings.json` diff + test-call verification with hard-stop + Jira per-tenant discovery.
- **`docs/setup-migrate.md` (FR-36 / AC-36.1..8)** — `/setup --migrate` entry point with atomicity guarantee, retry/rollback prompt in NFR-10 canonical shape, and `none→tracker` / `tracker→none` / `<tracker>→<other>` transition procedures.
- **`docs/implement-tracker-mode.md`, `docs/gate-check-tracker-mode.md`, `docs/pr-tracker-mode.md`, `docs/spec-write-tracker-mode.md`, `docs/spec-review-tracker-mode.md`** — per-skill companion docs keeping each skill under NFR-1 (≤300 lines).
- **`tests/fixtures/projects/`** — scenario fixtures (`mode-none-baseline`, `clean-sync`, `tracker-only-ac`, `edited-both`, `tracker-edited-mid-session`, `empty-ac`, `migration-none-to-linear`, `migration-tracker-to-none`, `migration-linear-to-jira`, `migration-atomicity-fail`, `capability-degradation`, `spec-review-tracker-only-ac`) — each documents the expected flow, fail conditions, and AC refs.
- **`tests/fixtures/mcp/{linear,jira}/`** — hand-crafted JSON response fixtures (no recorded PII).
- **`tests/scripts/{capture,verify}-regression.{sh,ts}`** — Pattern 9 byte-diff gate against `tests/fixtures/baselines/m1-m11-regression.snapshot`.

### Changed

- **Mode-aware probe wired into seven skills** (`/setup`, `/spec-write`, `/implement`, `/gate-check`, `/pr`, `/spec-review`, `/spec-archive`). Absence of `## Task Tracking` ≡ `mode: none` per AC-29.5; the tracker-mode branches are literally unreachable on the pre-M12 path (Pattern 9).
- **`skills/setup/SKILL.md`** — +`0. Tracker mode probe` for existing projects, +`0b. --migrate` invocation routing, +`7b. Tracker mode` opt-in question near end of flow (default `none`, skippable). 228 lines (≤300).
- **`skills/implement/SKILL.md`** — Phase 1 step 0 gains ticket-binding + `updatedAt` recording + FR-39 diff/resolve in tracker mode. 279 lines (≤300).
- **`skills/gate-check/SKILL.md`** — Tracker Mode Probe header adds `updatedAt` re-check with AC-39.10 two-option warning and `push_ac_toggle` on gate pass. 131 lines.
- **`skills/pr/SKILL.md`** — Tracker Mode Probe header adds `transition_status(in_review)` + optional `upsert_ticket_metadata` for PR URL (NFR-8 ≤2 MCP calls).
- **`skills/spec-write/SKILL.md`** — step 0 adds ticket-binding + post-save FR-39 diff/resolve before `upsert_ticket_metadata` (AC-34.7, AC-39.9).
- **`skills/spec-review/SKILL.md`** — step 0 pulls ACs via active adapter's `pull_acs` in tracker mode; `mode: none` reads local `specs/requirements.md` as before.
- **`skills/spec-archive/SKILL.md`** — step 0 clarifies that tracker-ticket archival is out of scope; archival still operates on local `specs/` content only.

### Fixed

- `/gate-check` tracker-mode branch explicitly does **not** run full FR-39 resolution (AC-39.10) — it only warns on `updatedAt` mismatch with a two-option response. This prevents bidirectional writes from sneaking into gate checks, which are supposed to be read-mostly.
- **Pre-migration on-disk backup** for `<tracker> → none` and `<tracker> → <other tracker>` migrations (`docs/setup-migrate.md` § Pre-migration on-disk backup). Both paths copy `CLAUDE.md` and `specs/requirements.md` to timestamped `*.pre-migrate-backup-<ISO>` files **before any local mutation**. Defense-in-depth for the FR-39 reconciliation phases: if a partial failure or unwanted merge corrupts local source-of-truth, the operator restores with `mv`. `none → <tracker>` skips the backup (path doesn't write locally until success). Failed `cp` hard-stops migration. Backups are not auto-deleted; sort lexically by ISO timestamp so re-runs never overwrite earlier backups.

### Pattern 9 regression

- `diff <regression-output> tests/fixtures/baselines/m1-m11-regression.snapshot` is empty. `mode: none` output byte-identical to pre-M12 baseline. Stop-ship gate passed.
- **Coverage widened** post-review: `verify-regression.sh` now iterates over three real-shape fixtures — `mode-none-baseline` (Node/TypeScript, original), `mode-none-flutter` (Dart/Flutter), and `mode-none-archived` (Python/FastAPI with archive content that deliberately quotes the `## Task Tracking` heading to prove the Schema L probe only reads `CLAUDE.md`). All three byte-identical to baseline.
- **Probe-wording parity gate** added (`tests/probe-parity.test.ts`, 15 tests): all 7 mode-aware skills must reference the canonical `Schema L probe (see docs/patterns.md § Tracker Mode Probe)` anchor, and the 6 non-`setup` skills must carry the verbatim `mode: none` no-op guard sentence. Catches silent drift if a future edit "improves" the probe in one skill but forgets the others.

### FRs covered

FR-29, FR-30, FR-31, FR-32, FR-33, FR-34, FR-35, FR-36, FR-37, FR-38, FR-39 (11 FRs, 80+ ACs). NFR-1 (size cap) holds for all modified skills. NFR-7 (adapter source ≤500 lines) holds for all helpers. NFR-10 (canonical error shape) applied consistently across AC-30.5, AC-33.4, AC-34.5, AC-35.4, AC-36.7, AC-38.6.

### Known limitations at ship

- **Tier 5 manual conformance** shipped as documented checklist; **not executed** against live Linear / Jira at v1.15.0. MCP tool names in each adapter are marked "provisional (Phase H conformance)" — they follow each tracker's public MCP documentation but have not been verified via authenticated `tools/list` introspection. First operator to authenticate against live MCPs should lock the names.
- Skill file sizes for companion-doc extraction (`docs/*-tracker-mode.md`) chosen conservatively to leave buffer under NFR-1.

## [1.14.1] — 2026-04-14 — "Drift Catcher"

### Fixed

- **`README.md` "Latest:" line refreshed to v1.14.0 "Single File"** — The release line had been left at v1.13.0 "Second Look" during the v1.14.0 bump, advertising the wrong release to new users on the main entry point.
- **`README.md` pattern count corrected from 14 to 22** — The Structure list claimed `docs/patterns.md` held "14 proven patterns"; the file has carried 22 numbered patterns since v1.12.x. Count had drifted silently across multiple releases.

### Changed

- **`CLAUDE.md` Release Checklist promoted from 3 files to 4** — `README.md` added as item #4, with explicit guidance to refresh the "Latest:" line and any counts in the Structure list that the release changed (skill count, pattern count, etc.). Trailing "All three must stay in sync" updated to "All four." Prevents the two drift patterns caught this release from recurring.

### Motivation

Two audit passes on v1.14.0 surfaced that the README had been silently drifting across releases: the "Latest:" line was one version stale, and the `patterns.md` count was 8 patterns behind reality. Root cause: the Release Checklist in `CLAUDE.md` only listed three files, so `README.md` was never on the sync-at-release list. This patch fixes the stale facts and adds the guardrail so future bumps can't miss the README.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-04-13 — "Single File"

### Added

- **Canonical one-at-a-time sentence in `brainstorm/SKILL.md` and `spec-write/SKILL.md` Rules (FR-28 / AC-28.1, AC-28.4, AC-28.5)** — Both skills now carry the byte-identical sentence `Ask one clarifying question per turn. Wait for the answer before asking the next. This rule holds at phase transitions too — when two questions look independent, still ask the first, wait, then ask the second.` as a Rules bullet. Treated as a cross-skill schema (NFR-4 precedent): a Tier 1 `diff` check catches drift on future edits.
- **`### Rationalization Prevention` subsection in `brainstorm/SKILL.md` (FR-28 / AC-28.2)** — New 2-column table (`Excuse` | `Reality`) with 4 rows targeting the specific excuses observed in the v1.13.0-session violation: "These two questions are independent" / "Ask the first, wait, then the second"; "Efficiency wins — batch them" / "Efficiency ≠ batching; the socratic form is the gate"; "The user is responsive, I'll batch" / "Responsiveness is not license to batch"; "We're at the handoff, last chance" / "Phase transitions are where batching happens most — same rule applies". Mirrors the pattern shipped by FR-24 in `/gate-check`.

### Changed

- **Per-section question blocks in `spec-write/SKILL.md` (FR-28 / AC-28.3, AC-28.7)** — The 4 blocks under `#### requirements.md`, `#### technical-spec.md`, `#### testing-spec.md`, `#### plan.md` reshaped from bulleted simultaneous-question lists to explicit ordered-waiting prose ("Ask {Q1}. Wait for the answer. Then ask {Q2}."). Same questions, same steps — only framing changed. No heading renames, no removed steps, no new required user-facing questions.

### Motivation

At the tail of the v1.13.0 session, Claude batched two independent scope-lock questions at the `/brainstorm` → `/spec-write` handoff despite both skills' explicit one-question-at-a-time rule. The rule was documented but not followed rigorously at phase transitions, and `/spec-write`'s bulleted per-section question blocks implicitly encouraged the same batching. This release tightens the wording in both skill files (where downstream-project memory cannot reach) and reshapes `/spec-write`'s structure so the socratic form is visible in the skill body itself. The Rationalization Prevention table targets the three rationalizations observed in-session ("these are independent", "efficiency", "responsive user") plus the phase-transition trap explicitly. Both skills remain well under the NFR-1 300-line budget (`brainstorm` 69, `spec-write` 146).

## [1.13.0] — 2026-04-13 — "Second Look"

### Added

- **Two-pass `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B (FR-23 / AC-23.1..23.8)** — Stage B now delegates to `code-reviewer` **twice in sequence** via the `Agent` tool. **Pass 1 — Spec Compliance** (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; silently skipped when `specs/` is absent) asks the subagent whether every change in the diff traces to an AC and flags any undocumented behavior. **Pass 2 — Code Quality** runs only if Pass 1 returned `OVERALL: OK` or Pass 1 was skipped, and applies the canonical 5-criterion rubric. The literal fail-fast rule `If Pass 1 returns critical findings, do NOT run Pass 2; surface Pass 1 findings and stop.` is in the skill body verbatim. Skipped Pass 2 is reported as the literal line `Pass 2: Skipped (Pass 1 critical findings)` under a `### Pass 2: Code Quality` subheading — never silently omitted. `implement/SKILL.md` grew from 238 → 274 lines (still 26 under NFR-1).
- **`### Pass-Specific Return Contracts` in `agents/code-reviewer.md` (FR-23 / AC-23.6)** — New subsection documents the two prompt shapes. Pass 1 returns one `AC-X.Y — OK|CONCERN` line per AC plus one catch-all `Undocumented behavior` line; Pass 2 returns one line per rubric criterion. Both end with `OVERALL: OK` or `OVERALL: CONCERNS (N)` — the existing Schema J shape, reused unchanged at the line level.
- **`### Rationalization Prevention` table in `gate-check/SKILL.md` Red Flags (FR-24 / AC-24.1..24.4)** — Two-column table (`Excuse` | `Reality`) borrowed from the `superpowers` plugin with the 6 canonical rows (`Should work now` / `Run the verification`, `I'm confident` / `Confidence ≠ evidence`, `Just this once` / `No exceptions`, `Linter passed` / `Linter ≠ compiler / tests`, `Agent said success` / `Verify independently`, `Partial check is enough` / `Partial proves nothing`) in that order. No verdict strings changed (NFR-4 preserved).
- **`plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/parallel-execution.md` (FR-25 / AC-25.1..25.8)** — New 75-line advisory doc (budget ≤200) covering `## Native Subagents` (links `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents`), `## Agent-Teams` (links `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams`), and `## Worktree-per-Subagent Isolation`. The top-of-file **Advisory only** disclaimer makes the opt-in framing explicit. The worktree section documents merge-back via `/implement`'s existing recovery options and file-partitioning for conflict avoidance.
- **`## Parallelization` subsection in `implement/SKILL.md` (FR-25 / AC-25.6)** — Placed immediately before `## Phase 3` (not buried in Phase 2 prose) with the literal pointer line `For parallelizable work, see docs/parallel-execution.md before dispatching.` Ensures the new doc is consulted on every `/implement` run instead of becoming dead weight.
- **`### Task Sizing` in `templates/spec-templates/plan.md.template` (FR-26 / AC-26.1..26.3)** — Tasks now render as 2-line entries (`- [ ] Action` + indented `verify:` line). New sizing note carries the literal `Each task should be ≈ one commit's worth of work — small enough that the verification step is unambiguous`. Anti-pattern callout lists three bad task shapes (`Implement entire feature`, `Refactor and add tests and update docs`, `Clean up technical debt`) each with a one-line reason.
- **`Task Sizing` reference in `spec-write/SKILL.md` (FR-26 / AC-26.4)** — `plan.md` step now instructs `/spec-write` to generate tasks conforming to the template's 2-line shape and points back at the template for the anti-pattern callout.

### Changed

- **`disable-model-invocation: true` dropped from `/implement` and `/pr` (FR-27 / AC-27.1..27.6)** — The flag was a leaky workaround blocking legitimate composition from agent-teams subagents (a subagent could not invoke `/implement` via the `Skill` tool and had to read `SKILL.md` body manually). Flag is retained on `/setup` only (bootstrap skill — a subagent re-running `/setup` mid-flight would clobber the working tree). `docs/skill-anatomy.md` Best Practices narrowed to recommend the flag only for bootstrap-style skills.
- **`docs/skill-anatomy.md` § Subagent Execution** — Gained a brief "Sequential multi-pass variant" note pointing at the Stage B two-pass template as the canonical example of stacking the `Agent`-tool primitive.
- **Root `CLAUDE.md` agent line** — Updated to describe `code-reviewer` as "invoked twice by /implement Stage B: Pass 1 spec-compliance, Pass 2 code-quality".
- **`README.md`** — `/implement` row describes the two-pass Stage B; `code-reviewer` agent bullet enumerates the pass-specific return contracts; Latest-release pointer updated to v1.13.0.

### Motivation

The single Stage B review from v1.12.0 conflated "did we build the right thing" (spec compliance) with "did we build it well" (code quality), leaving the subagent with no way to escalate a wrong-feature finding over a minor style nit. Splitting Pass 1 and Pass 2 with fail-fast between them makes the cheaper gate (spec compliance) the one that runs first and stops the review early when the change is fundamentally wrong. The rationalization-prevention table in `/gate-check` is the cheap deterrent against "should work now" / "I'm confident" / "linter passed" reasoning — same cost as a single bullet list, roughly one order of magnitude higher salience. `docs/parallel-execution.md` closes the documentation gap for the worktree + subagents + agent-teams patterns the toolkit already relies on (M10 itself was implemented under a team-lead + implementer pair inside a worktree) without pushing implementation-pattern prose into the ~270-line `implement/SKILL.md`. The `plan.md.template` tightening is the lesson from prior milestones where "Task 1 — Implement entire feature" showed up and there was no obvious verification step to gate on.

### Dogfood validation

Task 12 of M10 ran `/implement` on M10 itself end-to-end through the new two-pass Stage B. Pass 1 and Pass 2 both fired on the M10 change set and returned `OVERALL: OK`; a synthetic spec-drift variant (adding an undocumented function) was reasoned through to confirm Pass 2 is reported as `Pass 2: Skipped (Pass 1 critical findings)` on fail-fast, per AC-23.5. All four FRs passed Tier 1 static verification and Tier 2 behavioral scenarios.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-04-11 — "Dead Branches"

### Added

- **`/implement` Phase 3 Stage B now delegates to `code-reviewer` via explicit `Agent`-tool invocation (FR-22 / AC-22.2)** — Stage B is no longer an inline rubric copy. The skill spells out the exact prompt template (changed files from `git diff --name-status <base-ref>`, Phase 1 AC checklist as context, stack hints from CLAUDE.md, explicit instruction to **not** check spec compliance), the expected return shape (`<criterion> — OK` / `<criterion> — CONCERN: file:line — <reason>`, ending with `OVERALL: OK` or `OVERALL: CONCERNS (N)`), and the Stage B pass/fail integration logic including an inline-fallback path if the subagent errors or returns an unparseable shape.
- **`docs/skill-anatomy.md` gains a concrete `Agent`-tool delegation example (AC-22.8)** — The Subagent Execution section now leads with a copy-pasteable example adapted from `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B as the reference implementation. The existing abstract `context: fork` example is retained but explicitly labeled "Alternative — unexercised in this plugin as of v1.12.0" since 0 of 12 skills use that frontmatter.
- **`docs/implement-reference.md` gains a Milestone Archival Procedure section** — Sub-steps a–i (archive target resolution, collapse rule, write-then-delete ordering, incomplete-matrix fallback) moved here from the skill body to free up line budget for the new delegation block while keeping the procedure fully documented.

### Changed

- **`agents/code-reviewer.md` is now the canonical review rubric for the plugin (AC-22.3, AC-22.5)** — Stack-specific review checklist (Flutter / React / MCP / API) moved here from `implement/SKILL.md` Stage B. The old Spec Compliance section is deleted — `/spec-review` remains the sole canonical home for AC→code traceability, and `code-reviewer` now covers quality, security, patterns, and stack-specific only. The agent file documents its exact return shape at the bottom so callers can parse findings deterministically.
- **`gate-check/SKILL.md` Code Review section points at `agents/code-reviewer.md` as its rubric source (AC-22.4)** — Gate-check continues to run the review **inline** (synchronous, no delegation) because a gate verdict must return in one turn. Only the rubric source is unified, not the execution path.
- **`simplify/SKILL.md` wording aligned with `code-reviewer.md` where they overlap (AC-22.6)** — Simplify is not converted to delegation; its scope (reuse / quality / efficiency cleanup) remains distinct. Where criteria overlap (naming, hardcoded values, pattern compliance), simplify now explicitly defers to the code-reviewer rubric to prevent contradictory guidance.
- **`docs/adaptation-guide.md` Step 6 rewritten (AC-22.7)** — The stale `test-writer` and `debugger` bullets are gone; `code-reviewer` is described as the canonical review agent with `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B as the reference delegation point and a link to the `docs/skill-anatomy.md` example.
- **`plugins/dev-process-toolkit/skills/implement/SKILL.md` shrunk from 276 → 238 lines (AC-22.9)** — 38-line reduction buffers NFR-1 (300-line skill cap) for future Phase 3 additions. Achieved by compressing Pre-flight + Partial Failure Recovery, moving the Milestone Archival sub-steps to `implement-reference.md`, and delegating the Stage B rubric body to `code-reviewer.md`.
- **Skill and agent count across `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`** updated to reflect the single remaining agent.

### Removed

- **`plugins/dev-process-toolkit/agents/test-writer.md` deleted (AC-22.1)** — Orphaned since inception: zero skill invocation sites, weaker duplicate of `/tdd` (RED → GREEN → VERIFY with shallow-assertion anti-patterns). `rg 'test-writer' plugins/` now returns zero matches (CHANGELOG.md is the only remaining reference).
- **Spec Compliance section in `agents/code-reviewer.md`** — Deleted outright (not relocated). `/spec-review` was already the canonical home for AC→code traceability, and `code-reviewer` now covers quality, security, patterns, and stack-specific only.

### Motivation

A plugin audit on 2026-04-11 turned up two dead subagents (`code-reviewer` and `test-writer`) with zero invocation sites since the plugin's inception, plus duplicate review-rubric logic spread across four files (`gate-check`, `implement` Phase 3 Stage B, `simplify`, `code-reviewer.md`). `docs/skill-anatomy.md` documented `context: fork` + custom-agent delegation, but 0 of 12 skills exercised it — an advertised pattern that had never been road-tested. Meanwhile `implement/SKILL.md` sat at 276/300 against NFR-1 and its Stage B inlined ~60 lines of review rubric that would benefit from context-isolated delegation. v1.12.0 picks the boring, known-to-work path (explicit `Agent`-tool invocation from inside the skill body) rather than the unexercised `context: fork` alternative, gives `code-reviewer` a real delegation point so it stops being dead code, deletes `test-writer` so the plugin stops advertising an entry point that doesn't exist, and consolidates the review rubric into a single canonical home.

### Dogfood validation

As part of task 11 in M9, `/implement` was run against M9 itself and the new Stage B delegation was used to spawn `code-reviewer` on the in-flight change set. The subagent returned findings in the exact `OVERALL: CONCERNS (N)` shape the Stage B integration logic parses, caught legitimate issues (stale `test-writer` references in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`, an unresolved `<base-ref>` placeholder in the Stage B prompt template, skill-anatomy example missing an exclusion clause), and proved the delegation pattern is round-trip-executable by a fresh Claude instance reading the skill cold. All findings were resolved before the version bump.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-04-10 — "Residue Scan"

### Added

- **Post-archive drift check (FR-21)** — Every archival operation (both `/spec-archive` and `/implement` Phase 4 auto-archival) now runs a two-pass drift check and emits a unified Schema I advisory report. **Pass A** greps live spec files for orphan `M{N}` / `FR-{N}` / `AC-{N}.` token references that survived the archival (severity `high`). **Pass B** has Claude re-read each live spec with a bounded brief — just-archived IDs plus a one-paragraph title+goal excerpt of each new archive file — to flag scope-limiting narrative that assumes the archived milestones were the whole project (severity `medium`).
- **3-choice UX, never blocks archival** — When the drift report is non-empty, the user picks between addressing flags inline (with per-edit approval), saving the report to `specs/drift-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` for later, or acknowledging and continuing. Empty reports emit the literal `No drift detected` and continue silently. The archival operation itself is never blocked by drift findings, and Pass B never auto-edits narrative.
- **`docs/patterns.md` — `### Pattern: Post-Archive Drift Check`** — Documents the two-pass rationale, the Flutter dogfood canary example verbatim, why Pass B is load-bearing despite its false-positive rate, and the accuracy-first tradeoff decision from the brainstorm session.

### Motivation

The v1.10.0 dogfood run on a Flutter project surfaced the residue problem: archiving M1–M4 (documentation milestones) cleanly moved the blocks and ACs, but left `requirements.md` Overview calling the project a "layered documentation set" and Out-of-Scope saying "Code changes — documentation only" while M5 (a code milestone) was in flight. Pure grep missed it — the phrasing uses no literal `M{N}` tokens — and a manual four-file consistency pass after every archival was the cost. FR-21 makes that scan automatic and advisory, keeping the archival flow fast and the live specs honest.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-04-09 — "Bounded Context"

### Added

- **Auto-archival in `/implement` Phase 4 (FR-16)** — When a milestone ships and the human approves the Phase 4 report, the milestone block and its traceability-matched ACs move automatically out of `plan.md` / `requirements.md` into `specs/archive/M{N}-{slug}.md`, leaving blockquote pointer lines in place. Live spec files stay size-bounded regardless of project age; hot-path token cost stays roughly constant.
- **`/spec-archive` escape-hatch skill (FR-17)** — Manual archival for any user-selected milestone, FR, or AC block, with an explicit diff approval gate. Covers reopens, cross-cutting ACs, and anything auto-archival can't reach. Reopened milestones produce `-r2` / `-r3` revision files; the archive is append-only.
- **Stable anchor IDs on spec headings (FR-18)** — `{#M{N}}` and `{#FR-{N}}` anchors are now baked into the spec templates and enforced by `/spec-write` and the `/setup` doctor check. Archival pointers survive heading renames and reorders.
- **`specs/archive/` directory convention and rolling index (FR-19)** — `/setup` scaffolds `specs/archive/index.md` from day one. `/implement` and `/gate-check` never read the archive; `/spec-review` may consult the index on explicit historical queries.
- **Documentation, README, and project CLAUDE.md coverage (FR-20)** — `docs/patterns.md` gains an Archival Lifecycle pattern; `docs/sdd-methodology.md` documents compactable specs; `docs/adaptation-guide.md` gains a `## Customizing Archival` section; README lists the 12th skill and links here; project CLAUDE.md updates skill count.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** (this file) — Single place for release notes; replaces the previous "What's new" block in README.

### Changed

- Skill count: **11 → 12** (added `/spec-archive`).
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/skills/implement/SKILL.md` Phase 3 Stage C hardening examples extracted to `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/implement-reference.md` to stay under NFR-1's 300-line cap. Final size: 272 lines.
- Release checklist in `CLAUDE.md` now includes a mandatory CHANGELOG.md update step.

### Dogfood validation

As part of the M7 milestone, the shipped v1.8/v1.9 content (M1–M6 in `specs/plan.md` and FR-1..FR-15 in `specs/requirements.md`) was retroactively compacted into `specs/archive/` using the new `/spec-archive` skill. This both validates the feature end-to-end and proves NFR-5:

- `specs/plan.md`: **374 → 139 lines (−63%)**
- `specs/requirements.md`: **440 → 218 lines (−50%)**
- 6 Schema G archive files created (one per shipped milestone) plus `specs/archive/index.md`.

### Opt out

Delete `specs/archive/` — the auto-path skips silently when the directory is absent. See `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/adaptation-guide.md` § *Customizing Archival* for the full opt-out and manual-archival recipe.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-04-07 — M6: ADAPT Marker Cleanup

### Removed

- Manual setup path from docs and README — plugins run from the marketplace directory, users never edit skill files directly.
- `<!-- ADAPT -->` markers in `skills/**` and `agents/**` (converted to plain-text runtime LLM instructions that reference the project CLAUDE.md).

### Changed

- `docs/adaptation-guide.md` reframed as a "customize after `/setup`" reference rather than a manual-setup guide.
- Template `<!-- ADAPT -->` markers preserved (unchanged — templates are copied into user projects where manual edits are expected).

## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-07 — "Depth over Breadth"

### Added

- Drift detection in `/gate-check` and `/implement` Phase 4 (FR-1).
- Security scanning guidance in `/gate-check` Commands section (FR-2).
- CI/CD parity: structured JSON output from `/gate-check` plus starter GitHub Actions configs for TypeScript/Python/Flutter (FR-3).
- Doctor validation in `/setup` — checks tools, gate commands, CLAUDE.md, settings.json (FR-4).
- Spec deviation auto-extraction in `/implement` Phase 4 (FR-5).
- Spec breakout protocol in `/implement` (FR-6) — stop when ≥3 `contradicts`/`infeasible` deviations accumulate in one milestone.
- Spec-to-code traceability map in `/spec-review` (FR-7).
- Shallow test detection in `/tdd` and `/implement` (FR-8).
- Visual-check MCP fallback with manual verification checklist (FR-9).
- Structured risk scan in `/spec-write` with explicit categories + 3-tier severity (FR-10).
- Code-reviewer agent spec compliance section (FR-11).
- Worktree partial failure recovery in `/implement` (FR-12).
- Golden path workflows (Bugfix / Feature / Refactor) in CLAUDE.md template + `/setup` report (FR-13).
- Enhanced spec templates with security/abuse cases, measurable NFRs, negative ACs, ADR tables (FR-14).
- 6 cross-skill schemas (A–F) documented in `technical-spec.md` and enforced in NFR-4.

### Notes

- NFR-1 skill size cap: 300 lines per skill file with an overflow rule extracting long content to `docs/<skill-name>-reference.md`.
