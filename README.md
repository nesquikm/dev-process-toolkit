# Dev Process Toolkit

A portable collection of Claude Code skills, agents, templates, and documentation that help bootstrap and adapt **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows for any project.

## Quick Start

### New project

Starting from scratch — no code, no toolchain yet.

1. **Initialize your project** — Set up your language/framework (`npm init`, `flutter create`, `uv init`, etc.) and install a test runner and linter
2. **Copy skills** to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory
3. **Adapt gate commands** — Look for `<!-- ADAPT -->` comments in `gate-check/SKILL.md` and `tdd/SKILL.md`, replace the example commands with yours (see `examples/` for your stack)
4. **Set up CLAUDE.md** — Copy `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`, fill in every section (delete the HTML comments as you go)
5. **Write specs** — Use `templates/spec-templates/` to define what you're building (start with `requirements.md` and `plan.md`)
6. **Verify** — Run `/gate-check` to confirm your gate commands work (they should pass on an empty project)
7. **Run `/implement`** to start building features end-to-end

### Existing project

Adding SDD/TDD process to a project that already builds and tests.

1. **Copy skills** to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory
2. **Adapt gate commands** — Look for `<!-- ADAPT -->` comments in `gate-check/SKILL.md` and `tdd/SKILL.md`, replace the example commands with yours (see `examples/` for your stack)
3. **Set up CLAUDE.md** — Copy `templates/CLAUDE.md.template`, fill in every section (delete the HTML comments as you go)
4. **Verify** — Run `/gate-check` to confirm all gates pass on your current codebase
5. **Start using** — Run `/tdd` for test-first development, `/implement` for full features, `/pr` when ready to push

Write specs later if you want the full SDD workflow, or skip them and use `/implement` with inline task descriptions.

For detailed adaptation instructions, see `docs/adaptation-guide.md`.

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."
