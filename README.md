# Dev Process Toolkit

A Claude Code plugin that adds **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows to any project. Includes 12 commands, 1 agent, spec templates, and documentation.

## Install as Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add nesquikm/dev-process-toolkit
/plugin install dev-process-toolkit@nesquikm-dev-process-toolkit
```

Then run the setup command in your project:

```
/dev-process-toolkit:setup
```

This detects your stack, generates a CLAUDE.md, configures settings, and optionally creates spec files — all adapted to your project.

## What You Get

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/dev-process-toolkit:setup` | Set up SDD/TDD process for your project |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:brainstorm` | Socratic design session before writing specs (for open-ended features) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-write` | Guide through writing spec files (requirements, technical, testing, plan) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:implement` | End-to-end feature implementation with TDD and bounded three-stage self-review (Stage A spec compliance → Stage B two-pass delegated review: Pass 1 spec compliance, Pass 2 code quality, fail-fast → Stage C hardening) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:tdd` | RED → GREEN → VERIFY cycle |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:gate-check` | Deterministic quality gates (typecheck + lint + test) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:debug` | Structured debugging protocol for failing tests or unclear gate failures |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-review` | Audit code against spec requirements |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-archive` | Manually archive a milestone, FR, or AC block into `specs/archive/` with diff approval; runs a post-archive drift check (Pass A grep + Pass B semantic scan) on finish (FR-17, FR-21) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:visual-check` | Browser-based UI verification via MCP |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:pr` | Pull request creation |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:simplify` | Code quality review and cleanup |

### Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Canonical code review rubric (quality, security, patterns, stack-specific) plus pass-specific return contracts for the Stage B two-pass flow. Invoked twice by `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B via `Agent`-tool delegation — Pass 1 spec compliance (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; fail-fast), Pass 2 code quality; referenced inline by `/gate-check` Code Review.

## Release Notes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history. Latest: **v1.15.0 — "Tracker Integration"** (opt-in tracker mode for teams whose ACs live in Linear / Jira / custom — bidirectional AC sync with per-AC B-style conflict prompts, live MCP + `updatedAt` optimistic concurrency, no persistent cache, source-only distribution via Bun; `mode: none` default is byte-identical to pre-M12 per Pattern 9 regression gate; FR-29..39, 11 FRs, 80+ ACs).

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."
