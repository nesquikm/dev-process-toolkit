# Dev Process Toolkit

A Claude Code plugin that adds **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows to any project. Includes 12 commands, 1 agent, spec templates, and documentation.

## Install as Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add nesquikm/dev-process-toolkit
/plugin install dev-process-toolkit@nesquikm-dev-process-toolkit
```

Then run the setup command in your project:

```
/dev-process-toolkit:setup
```

This detects your stack, generates a CLAUDE.md, configures settings, and optionally creates spec files — all adapted to your project.

## What You Get

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/dev-process-toolkit:setup` | Set up SDD/TDD process for your project |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:brainstorm` | Socratic design session before writing specs (for open-ended features) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-write` | Guide through writing spec files (requirements, technical, testing, plan) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:implement` | End-to-end feature implementation with TDD and bounded three-stage self-review (Stage A spec compliance → Stage B two-pass delegated review: Pass 1 spec compliance, Pass 2 code quality, fail-fast → Stage C hardening) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:tdd` | RED → GREEN → VERIFY cycle |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:gate-check` | Deterministic quality gates (typecheck + lint + test) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:debug` | Structured debugging protocol for failing tests or unclear gate failures |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-review` | Audit code against spec requirements |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-archive` | Manually archive a FR (by ULID or tracker ref) or milestone (`M<N>` group) via `git mv` into `specs/frs/archive/` / `specs/plan/archive/` with diff approval; runs a post-archive drift check (Pass A grep + Pass B semantic scan) on finish (FR-17, FR-21, FR-45) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:visual-check` | Browser-based UI verification via MCP |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:pr` | Pull request creation |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:simplify` | Code quality review and cleanup |

### Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Canonical code review rubric (quality, security, patterns, stack-specific) plus pass-specific return contracts for the Stage B two-pass flow. Invoked twice by `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B via `Agent`-tool delegation — Pass 1 spec compliance (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; fail-fast), Pass 2 code quality; referenced inline by `/gate-check` Code Review.

## Release Notes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history. Latest: **v1.22.0 — "Branch Convention"** (`/implement` gains optional branch-naming automation via a new Schema L `branch_template:` key — `{type}/m{N}-{slug}` default in `mode: none`, `{type}/{ticket-id}-{slug}` in tracker mode; LLM infers `{type, slug}` from the FR / plan body; sanitizer clamps output to `[a-z0-9-]` before `git checkout -b` (shell-injection defense in depth); absent key ⇒ disabled. `TrackerProvider.releaseLock` gains a pre-state assertion that fails loudly on non-`in_progress` tickets (guards against the `Backlog → Done` silent leap surfaced in the M18 dogfood). `/spec-write` + `/brainstorm` now codify the `<tracker-id>` placeholder convention — never guess the next sequential tracker number. Full 26-char ULIDs are hidden from tracker-mode user-facing prose (Linear descriptions, plan-file FR lists, active CHANGELOG section, README) — the ULID lives in frontmatter `id:` and code-internal references only. One-time PR garbage sweep retired 31 files from the M12–M18 accumulation. STE-63..STE-67, 5 FRs.).

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."

## Proven Across

- **TypeScript/React/Vite** — web analytics dashboard
- **TypeScript/Node/MCP** — MCP server
- **Flutter/Dart** — retail mobile app

### Examples Provided For

- **Python** — stack-detection config + CLAUDE.md template under `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/examples/python/` (not dogfooded in production by the plugin author, but the `/setup` detection path and example config are maintained alongside the TypeScript and Flutter examples).
