# Dev Process Toolkit

A Claude Code plugin that adds **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows to any project. Includes 14 commands, 1 agent, spec templates, and documentation.

## Install as Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add nesquikm/dev-process-toolkit
```

```
/plugin install dev-process-toolkit@nesquikm-dev-process-toolkit
```

Then run the setup command in your project:

```
/dev-process-toolkit:setup
```

This detects your stack, generates a CLAUDE.md, configures settings, and optionally creates spec files — all adapted to your project.

## Workflow

The toolkit groups its 14 user-invoked skills into a four-phase lifecycle. Read top-down for the full path, or jump to whichever phase matches what you're doing now.

    end
    Setup --> Plan
    Plan --> Build
    Build --> Ship
```

Under the hood, `/implement` performs TDD inline (write test → RED → code → GREEN) rather than invoking the `/tdd` skill, and runs gate commands inline (e.g., `bun test`) rather than invoking the `/gate-check` skill (which layers probes on top of those commands). It does invoke `/docs --quick` once per FR for the Phase 4b doc fragment. After self-review and human approval, `/implement` commits and stops — you open the PR via `/pr` separately. `/ship-milestone` invokes `/docs --commit --full` to fold staged fragments into the canonical docs tree before cutting the release commit.

Spine skills (bold, stadium-shaped) are the recommended invoke path; secondary skills (muted rectangles) are auxiliary tools and auto-invoked helpers.

Tracker integration (Linear, Jira, or `mode: none`) threads through Plan → Build → Ship: `/spec-write` files the FR, `/implement` claims it on entry and releases on success, and `/ship-milestone` archives the milestone group.

All commits in toolkit-managed repositories follow [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), enforced locally by a `commit-msg` hook that `/setup` installs (a POSIX-shell hook by default; opt into `--commitlint` for projects with Node/Bun tooling).

### Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Canonical code review rubric (quality, security, patterns, stack-specific) plus pass-specific return contracts for the Stage B two-pass flow. Invoked twice by `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B via `Agent`-tool delegation — Pass 1 spec compliance (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; fail-fast), Pass 2 code quality; referenced inline by `/gate-check` Code Review.

## Release Notes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history. Latest: **v1.38.0 — "Tighten"** (M38 ships **branch ship-readiness** — four audit findings cleared before the long `feat/m12-tracker-integration` branch can merge to `main`. STE-135 fixes a silent data-loss path where `findFRByTrackerRef` always returned null in tracker mode and `/spec-write` re-imported over local edits — new `findFRPathByTrackerRef` helper + mode-aware skill prose. STE-136 appends the missing `## Docs` section to the dogfood `CLAUDE.md` so probe #18 is green; adds a repo-self-check row so future drift surfaces in `bun test`. STE-137 strips this repo's internal `STE-N` / `M<N>` namespace from shipped templates + examples (Tier-1), inlines a broken `docs/patterns.md` link in `testing-spec.md.template`, and adds a regression test that strips fenced code blocks and asserts no internal IDs leak. STE-138 fixes the self-drifted `## Release Checklist` (4 → 5 files; the missing 5th is `specs/requirements.md`; `## Structure` → `## What's Inside` to match README's actual section); new consistency test guards path/heading/count invariants. Minor bump — STE-137 alters user-visible template output. Test count: 1071 → 1083 (+12).

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."

## Proven Across

- **TypeScript/React/Vite** — web analytics dashboard
- **TypeScript/Node/MCP** — MCP server
- **Flutter/Dart** — retail mobile app

### Examples Provided For

- **Python** — stack-detection config + CLAUDE.md template under `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/examples/python/` (not dogfooded in production by the plugin author, but the `/setup` detection path and example config are maintained alongside the TypeScript and Flutter examples).
