# Dev Process Toolkit

A Claude Code plugin that adds **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows to any project. Includes 14 commands, 1 agent, spec templates, and documentation.

## Install as Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add nesquikm/dev-process-toolkit
/plugin install dev-process-toolkit@nesquikm-dev-process-toolkit
```

Then run the setup command in your project:

```
/dev-process-toolkit:setup
```

This detects your stack, generates a CLAUDE.md, configures settings, and optionally creates spec files — all adapted to your project.

## What You Get

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/dev-process-toolkit:setup` | Set up SDD/TDD process for your project |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:brainstorm` | Socratic design session before writing specs (for open-ended features) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-write` | Guide through writing spec files (requirements, technical, testing, plan) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:implement` | End-to-end feature implementation with TDD and bounded three-stage self-review (Stage A spec compliance → Stage B two-pass delegated review: Pass 1 spec compliance, Pass 2 code quality, fail-fast → Stage C hardening) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:tdd` | RED → GREEN → VERIFY cycle |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:gate-check` | Deterministic quality gates (typecheck + lint + test) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:debug` | Structured debugging protocol for failing tests or unclear gate failures |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-review` | Audit code against spec requirements |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:spec-archive` | Manually archive a FR (by ULID or tracker ref) or milestone (`M<N>` group) via `git mv` into `specs/frs/archive/` / `specs/plan/archive/` with diff approval; runs a post-archive drift check (Pass A grep + Pass B semantic scan) on finish (FR-17, FR-21, FR-45) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:visual-check` | Browser-based UI verification via MCP |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:docs` | Generate or update project docs — staged fragments (`--quick`), human-approved merge (`--commit`), or full canonical regeneration (`--full`) |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:pr` | Pull request creation |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:simplify` | Code quality review and cleanup |
| `/dev-process-toolkit:ship-milestone` | Bundle the Release Checklist + `/docs --commit --full` into one atomic, human-approved release commit |

### Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Canonical code review rubric (quality, security, patterns, stack-specific) plus pass-specific return contracts for the Stage B two-pass flow. Invoked twice by `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B via `Agent`-tool delegation — Pass 1 spec compliance (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; fail-fast), Pass 2 code quality; referenced inline by `/gate-check` Code Review.

## Release Notes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history. Latest: **v1.34.0 — "Tripwires"** (M32 closes the producing-skill side of three M31-class discretionary checks surfaced by smoke-test 2026-04-27. STE-121 ships `buildFRFrontmatter` helper + post-write `runFrontmatterShapeCheck` self-check + one-time dry-run migration script for active tracker-mode FRs that still carry `id:` despite STE-110's prose flip. STE-122 flips `templates/spec-templates/requirements.md.template` to `AC-<tracker-id>.<N>` placeholders (mirroring STE-66's filename rule) + ships `scanGuessedTrackerIdLiterals` post-write scanner with fenced / 4-space-indented / inline-backtick exemptions; the regex catches only the bare-digit milestone-numbered shape so canonical `AC-STE-1.1` and `AC-VDTAF4.1` round-trip clean. STE-123 adds `/setup` §8a audit-section post-condition + `synthesizeAuditSection` helper reusing probe-19's `hasDefaultApplicableOutcomes` predicate (now exported) as single source of truth; refuses with `AuditPostconditionUnsatisfiable` when CLAUDE.md shows default-applied outcomes but /setup's in-memory map is empty. Probes #13/#15/#19 stay at gate time as the safety net for paths that bypass /spec-write or /setup. Bundled bookkeeping: `specs/requirements.md` baseline jumped from `v1.32.0 ('Re-shelve')` to `v1.33.0 ('Guardrails')` to clear M31's missed root-hygiene line. Test count: 937 → 1005 (+68).).

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."

## Proven Across

- **TypeScript/React/Vite** — web analytics dashboard
- **TypeScript/Node/MCP** — MCP server
- **Flutter/Dart** — retail mobile app

### Examples Provided For

- **Python** — stack-detection config + CLAUDE.md template under `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/examples/python/` (not dogfooded in production by the plugin author, but the `/setup` detection path and example config are maintained alongside the TypeScript and Flutter examples).

## Documentation

- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/sdd-methodology.md` — What SDD is and how it works
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/skill-anatomy.md` — How Claude Code skills work
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/adaptation-guide.md` — Reference for customizing skills and configuration after `/setup`
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/patterns.md` — 25 proven patterns + anti-patterns
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/layout-reference.md` — spec layout behavioral contract (file-per-FR keyed by tracker ID / short-ULID; ULID in frontmatter; Provider interface; skill integration map)
