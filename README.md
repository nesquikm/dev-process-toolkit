# Dev Process Toolkit

A Claude Code plugin that adds **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows to any project. Includes 14 commands, 1 agent, spec templates, and documentation.

## Features

- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** — requirements, technical, testing, and plan files as the source of truth
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** — RED → GREEN → VERIFY cycle, performed inline by `/implement`
- **Bounded self-review** — three-stage loop with a delegated `code-reviewer` agent, capped before human escalation
- **Deterministic quality gates** — typecheck + lint + test override LLM judgment
- **Diátaxis docs generation** — staged fragments per FR, human-approved merge, full canonical regen
- **Task tracker sync** — Linear, Jira, or `none`; auto-claim on FR start, auto-release on archive
- **Conventional Commits v1.0.0** — local `commit-msg` hook (POSIX shell or opt-in `commitlint`)
- **Atomic release commits** — `/ship-milestone` enforces the five-file release checklist
- **Spec lifecycle management** — ULID-keyed FRs, manual archival, post-archive drift checks
- **Browser-based UI verification** — `/visual-check` via Chrome DevTools MCP
- **Stack-adaptive setup** — auto-detects TypeScript, Flutter, Python; generates `CLAUDE.md` and settings

## Install as Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add nesquikm/dev-process-toolkit
```

```
/plugin install dev-process-toolkit@nesquikm-dev-process-toolkit
```

Then run the setup command in your project:

```
/dev-process-toolkit:setup
```

This detects your stack, generates a CLAUDE.md, configures settings, and optionally creates spec files — all adapted to your project.

## Workflow

The toolkit groups its 14 user-invoked skills into a four-phase lifecycle. Read left-to-right for the full path, or jump to whichever phase matches what you're doing now.

```

Under the hood, `/implement` performs TDD inline (write test → RED → code → GREEN) rather than invoking the `/tdd` skill, and runs gate commands inline (e.g., `bun test`) rather than invoking the `/gate-check` skill (which layers probes on top of those commands). It does invoke `/docs --quick` once per FR for the Phase 4b doc fragment. After self-review and human approval, `/implement` commits and stops — you open the PR via `/pr` separately. `/ship-milestone` invokes `/docs --commit --full` to fold staged fragments into the canonical docs tree before cutting the release commit.

Spine skills (bold, stadium-shaped) are the recommended invoke path; secondary skills (muted rectangles) are auxiliary tools and auto-invoked helpers.

Tracker integration (Linear, Jira, or `mode: none`) threads through Plan → Build → Ship: `/spec-write` files the FR, `/implement` claims it on entry and releases on success, and `/ship-milestone` archives the milestone group.

All commits in toolkit-managed repositories follow [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), enforced locally by a `commit-msg` hook that `/setup` installs (a POSIX-shell hook by default; opt into `--commitlint` for projects with Node/Bun tooling).

### Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Canonical code review rubric (quality, security, patterns, stack-specific) plus pass-specific return contracts for the Stage B two-pass flow. Invoked twice by `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B via `Agent`-tool delegation — Pass 1 spec compliance (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; fail-fast), Pass 2 code quality; referenced inline by `/gate-check` Code Review.

## Release Notes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history. Latest: **v1.46.0 — "Tandem"** (M46 ships per-tracker artifact isolation in the project-local `/smoke-test` driver and a "No claim on create" invariant in `/spec-write`. STE-159 rewrites every per-run `/smoke-test` artifact to a `<tracker>`-keyed path so two terminals — one Linear, one Jira — can run concurrently in tandem without filesystem collision: test-project basename becomes `../dpt-test-project-{linear,jira}`, every `/tmp/dpt-smoke-*` artifact carries a tracker suffix. Pre-flight #6's basename check is now a closed two-element allow-list enforced via `case` membership; three new negative cases (bare basename, garbage suffix, case mismatch) join the existing six-case adversarial probe. A new "Operator-driven parallelism" subsection codifies the two-terminal tandem run, the rate-limit caveat (~70% of theoretical 2× wall-clock win, ~11–14 min total for tandem vs. ~10 min solo, single Anthropic key), the no-merged-findings invariant, and the failure-isolation guarantee. Threat-model section rewritten to the two-basename framing. STE-160 inserts the "No claim on create" invariant in `/spec-write` § 0b step 4: freshly-created tracker tickets MUST land in the tracker's default state (Linear `Backlog` unassigned; Jira project start state); the claim is `/implement` Phase 1's job, not `/spec-write`'s. Names both Linear (`save_issue.state` / `assignee`) and Jira (`transitionJiraIssue`) failure modes by canonical MCP-tool name. Origin: regression caught during STE-159's own spec-write run. Operator-deferred AC-STE-159.6 / AC-STE-160.3 (smoke gates) — roll forward into M47's smoke #8. Minor bump — skill-prose changes only; no plugin-facing API change. Test count: 1240 → 1240 (+0).

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."

## Proven Across

- **TypeScript/React/Vite** — web analytics dashboard
- **TypeScript/Node/MCP** — MCP server
- **Flutter/Dart** — retail mobile app

### Examples Provided For

- **Python** — stack-detection config + CLAUDE.md template under `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/examples/python/` (not dogfooded in production by the plugin author, but the `/setup` detection path and example config are maintained alongside the TypeScript and Flutter examples).

## Documentation

- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/sdd-methodology.md` — What SDD is and how it works
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/skill-anatomy.md` — How Claude Code skills work
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/adaptation-guide.md` — Reference for customizing skills and configuration after `/setup`
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/patterns.md` — 25 proven patterns + anti-patterns
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/layout-reference.md` — spec layout behavioral contract (file-per-FR keyed by tracker ID / short-ULID; ULID in frontmatter; Provider interface; skill integration map)
