# Dev Process Toolkit

A Claude Code plugin that adds **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** and **TDD** workflows to any project. Includes 14 commands, 1 agent, spec templates, and documentation.

## Install as Plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add nesquikm/dev-process-toolkit
```

```
/plugin install dev-process-toolkit@nesquikm-dev-process-toolkit
```

Then run the setup command in your project:

```
/dev-process-toolkit:setup
```

This detects your stack, generates a CLAUDE.md, configures settings, and optionally creates spec files — all adapted to your project.

## Workflow

The toolkit groups its 14 user-invoked skills into a four-phase lifecycle. Read top-down for the full path, or jump to whichever phase matches what you're doing now.

    end
    subgraph Build

        visual_check["/visual-check"]
        simplify["/simplify"]
        spec_review["/spec-review"]
    end
    subgraph Ship
        spec_archive["/spec-archive"]
        docs["/docs"]
        pr["/pr"]
        ship_milestone["/ship-milestone"]
    end
    Setup --> Plan
    Plan --> Build
    Build --> Ship
```

Under the hood, `/implement` orchestrates `/tdd`, `/gate-check`, `/docs --quick`, and `/pr`; `/ship-milestone` invokes `/docs --commit --full` to fold staged fragments into the canonical docs tree before cutting the release commit. Treat the diagram as the user-facing surface — these internal calls are deliberately hidden so the four phases stay legible.

Tracker integration (Linear, Jira, or `mode: none`) threads through Plan → Build → Ship: `/spec-write` files the FR, `/implement` claims it on entry and releases on success, and `/ship-milestone` archives the milestone group.

### Agents

- **code-reviewer** — Canonical code review rubric (quality, security, patterns, stack-specific) plus pass-specific return contracts for the Stage B two-pass flow. Invoked twice by `/implement` Phase 3 Stage B via `Agent`-tool delegation — Pass 1 spec compliance (gated on `specs/requirements.md` existing; fail-fast), Pass 2 code quality; referenced inline by `/gate-check` Code Review.

## Release Notes

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full release history. Latest: **v1.35.0 — "Trace"** (M33 closes the M32-class gap surfaced by smoke-test 2026-04-27 run #4. STE-125 wires `rewriteArchiveLinks` into `/implement` Phase 4 so traceability links rewrite atomically with the FR archive `git mv` — the next `/gate-check` probe #23 sees a clean tree, no manual fix-up between commit and gate. STE-126 ships `cleanupPlanVerifyLines` helper + new gate probe #28 `plan-verify-line-validity` (warning) so deleted-file `verify:` lines in active plans are rewritten to the replacement test or marked `[x]` + dropped, and prose drift is caught at gate time. STE-127 flips `/spec-write` Step 7 from advisory to mandatory: every successful run emits a closing summary >=100 bytes naming FR id + path + milestone, regardless of mode (`linear` / `jira` / `none`) or non-interactive `-p` mode. STE-128 picks `src/`-co-located as the toolkit's default test layout, documents it in `docs/patterns.md` § Test Layout Policy, updates testing-spec template + CLAUDE.md template `Layout:` line + `/setup` placeholder default, and extends probe #20 to enforce the declared layout (permissive when absent — the toolkit's own `tests/` mirror is grandfathered). STE-129 declares `specs/requirements.md` cross-cutting only: drops the `### FR-1: [Feature Name]` placeholder block, adds cross-cutting topic examples (auth / observability / accessibility / tenancy), and ships gate probe #29 `requirements-md-no-placeholder` (warning) that flags surviving placeholders outside fenced spans + HTML comments. Test count: 1009 → 1049 (+40).).

## Core Philosophy

Three layers prevent AI agents from going off the rails:

1. **Specs** — Human-written requirements are the source of truth
2. **Deterministic gates** — Typecheck + lint + test must pass (no LLM judgment)
3. **Bounded self-review** — Max 2 rounds, then escalate to human

The key insight: **deterministic checks always override LLM judgment**. A failing test means "fix it," not "maybe it's fine."

## Proven Across

- **TypeScript/React/Vite** — web analytics dashboard
- **TypeScript/Node/MCP** — MCP server
- **Flutter/Dart** — retail mobile app

### Examples Provided For

- **Python** — stack-detection config + CLAUDE.md template under `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/examples/python/` (not dogfooded in production by the plugin author, but the `/setup` detection path and example config are maintained alongside the TypeScript and Flutter examples).

## Documentation

- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/sdd-methodology.md` — What SDD is and how it works
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/skill-anatomy.md` — How Claude Code skills work
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/adaptation-guide.md` — Reference for customizing skills and configuration after `/setup`
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/patterns.md` — 25 proven patterns + anti-patterns
- `plugins/dev-process-toolkit/docs/layout-reference.md` — spec layout behavioral contract (file-per-FR keyed by tracker ID / short-ULID; ULID in frontmatter; Provider interface; skill integration map)
